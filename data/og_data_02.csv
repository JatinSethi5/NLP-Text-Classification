religion,"did you ever meet someone you just knew was going to change your life dr. nori rost leaves lots of people feeling like that. nori is one of the most deep hearted and dedicated people i know. as a spiritual educator she shares my enthusiasm for interfaith study and conversation and she s served on the in good faith clergy panel since its inception in 2013. her decades of social justice leadership in the pikes peak region have resulted in measurable shifts and changes. she s as brilliant as she is irreverently funny and she s leaving our city for the big apple at the end of june. in this last interview with her i asked nori to reflect a bit on her time here. i moved to colorado springs in january 1994 in the wake of amendment 2. over 50 percent of voters passed that legislation two years earlier making it illegal for state and local governments to include sexual orientation in their anti discrimination clauses. i came to serve pikes peak metropolitan community church as their minister specifically to speak out against this. at that time colorado springs was known as ground zero colorado was called the hate state. in my 12 years of service there i led demonstrations outside of focus on the family when they held their anti gay conferences being a voice of faith for a community that had been cast out from their churches and homes. then in 2008 i made a uu turn unitarian universalist broadening my definition of faith to one that included pagans buddhists atheists humanists theists those who are seeking. i became the minister at all souls unitarian universalist church taking my activism with me speaking out for justice in marginalized communities. we became the sole sanctuary congregation housing neighbors threatened with deportation so that they could continue seeking legal residency here. in my 27 years in colorado springs the religious right groups that championed amendment 2 have largely become irrelevant. our city and our state have become more diverse and progressive. we now have a gay governor who seeks to include all at the table of justice. while those who would exclude others based on sexual orientation race and other issues still hold sway politically our city has shifted culturally to one of compassion and inclusion. as i prepare to leave colorado springs for new york city where i ll lead the new york society for ethical culture i m proud of the work we ve done here. because we refused to abide by the bigoted views of some we ve changed our city. we ve come a long way but there is still much to do. those of us with white privilege must continue the hard work of dismantling white supremacy. we must continue to fight the onslaught against women s agency over their bodies. if women and the bipoc communities can gain true emancipation from white patriarchy we will have set the stage for justice to come to all. i will continue the same in nyc. i am grateful for the activist communities in colorado springs. i was forged in the fire of justice here. i take that strength with me as i leave. ahriana platten is founder executive director of in good faith leads unity spiritual center and speaks around the country on the topics of interfaith and intercultural understanding.

health,"the ability to insert desirable genes into animal or human cells is the basis of modern life science research and of widespread biomedical applications. the methods used to date for this purpose are mostly non specific making it difficult for scientists to control which cell will or will not take up a gene. for this gene transfer the target genes are often packaged into viral vectors. these are viruses in which part of the genetic material has been replaced by the target genes. when researchers add these viral vectors to cells the vectors introduce the genes into the cells. this is the principle behind some of the current sars cov 2 vaccines such as those from astrazeneca or johnson johnson. however it is difficult even impossible to control into which cells the target genes enter since the viral vectors tend to dock non specifically onto all cells of a certain cell type. a team of researchers from the cluster of excellence cibss centre for integrative biological signalling studies at the university of freiburg led by dr. maximilian h rner prof. dr. wolfgang schamel and prof. dr. wilfried weber has developed a new technology that enables them to introduce target genes in a controlled manner and thereby control processes in individual selected cells. in their new method the freiburg researchers introduce the genetic information with an optical remote control. as a result only cells that are illuminated with red light take up the desired genes. to do this the scientists modified a type of viral vector known as an aav vector which is already in clinical use. we took away the viral vector s ability to dock with cells h rner explains which is an essential step before the genetic material can be introduced. to enable this control by light the researchers have taken a red light photoreceptor system from the plant arabidopsis thaliana thale cress . this system consists of two proteins phyb and pif which bind to each other as soon as phyb is illuminated with red light. the freiburg team placed the protein pif on the surface of the viral vector and modified the other protein phyb so that it could bind to human cells. once this modified vector called optoaav is in a cell culture along with the cell binding protein the protein binds to all cells. if a selected cell is now illuminated with red light the modified vector can bind to this cell and introduce the target genes into the illuminated cell h rner explains. a key aspect of biological signal research . this new approach allows the researchers to introduce target genes into the desired cells within a tissue culture. the scientists also succeeded in illuminating the tissue culture successively at different locations thus enabling the targeted introduction of different genes into different cells within a culture. with this technique it is now possible to control desired processes in individual cells. this is essential for understanding how a single cell communicates with cells in its environment for example to control the development or regeneration of an organ. as these viral vectors become more widely used in the therapeutic field weber says we think this new technology has the potential to make such biomedical applications more precise. original publication h rner m. jerez longres c. hudek a. hook s. yousefi o. s. schamel w. w. a. h rner c. zurbriggen m. d. ye h. wagner h. j. weber spatiotemporally confined red light controlled gene delivery at single cell resolution using adeno associated viral vectors science advances 2021 vol. both during and after infection with the coronavirus sars cov 2 patients may suffer from severe neurological symptoms including anosmia the loss of taste and smell typically associated with covid 19. along with direct damage caused by the virus researchers suspect a role for excessive . more . pipettes are important tools for scientists when transporting liquids in medical pharmaceutical biology and chemistry laboratories. using pipettes precisely is especially important when repeating experiments. the university of freiburg researchers julius wiener tobias zundel and oliver . more . automated cell research with the help of artificial intelligence . in biological cell research automated experiments are increasingly becoming the standard and enable meaningful reproducible results. a team of freiburg researchers would like to make the work of laboratory staff even easier jonas bermeitinger dennis raith and avani sapre founded labmai . more .

lifestyle,"moving portugal from the green to the amber travel list could be politically motivated an infection expert has said. arrivals from the popular holiday destination will be made to quarantine

the university of edinburgh suggested however that the decision could have been made as retaliation in response to european countries requiring britons to quarantine upon arrival. when asked whether or not moving portugal to the amber list was a necessary measure dr tait burkard said not necessarily in terms of case levels. portugal is still very similar to the uk actually and so that means the actual risk of going to the country is not necessarily higher than staying in the uk. what has made the decision to some extent is that portugal now also has the delta variant. we should probably not be surprised given that british tourists went there and we have a large number of delta variant cases. there s also concern about a so called nepal variant which is kind of a mix of the delta variants and the kent alpha variant. dr tait burkard went on to mention how once again the announcement had been very last minute and added that there could be a little bit of political retaliation behind that as well. speaking on the bbc good morning scotland programme she added it potentially is also a little bit politically motivated seeing that many european countries have put the uk on the quarantine

unrest,"washington newly unveiled efforts to combat a growing domestic terrorism threat in the united states will have to find a way to overcome a major obstacle carefully crafted campaigns by foreign countries and terrorist groups to incite violence. the warning from a senior department of homeland security official comes just a day after president joe biden issued his long awaited national strategy for countering domestic terrorism described by his administration as the first of its kind. the biden administration has downplayed direct links between violent extremists in the and those outside the country one senior official noted that intelligence agencies did not find a robust nexus between domestic terrorism and foreign actors. other officials caution however that is because the relationship does not follow a standard command and control model. a central element of the current threat is to take narratives that may influence violent behavior and get it out as broadly as you can department of homeland security counterterrorism coordinator john cohen told a webinar wednesday hosted by the george washington university program on extremism. we are seeing common narratives that seem to be resonating with individuals who are looking for extremist ideological beliefs to serve as the justification for violence being introduced by foreign nation states being introduced by foreign terrorist organizations cohen said. there are threat actors whether it s foreign governments like russia or iran or china or extremist thought leaders or terrorist groups that are taking advantage of that anger and the polarization of our society he said. concerns about foreign influences on domestic extremists in the united states are not new. an unclassified assessment by the office of the director of national intelligence issued this past march raised concerns about connections between white supremacists in the and those in other countries noting small numbers of extremists have been traveling in an effort to forge stronger ties. cohen though warned those types of connections pale in comparison with those that are developing in the virtual environment. this is not a threat that we can investigate or we can mitigate simply by looking at the physical activities of individuals who may be involved in preparing to conduct an attack he said. we have to understand more about how extremist thought leaders and those working in a leaderless resistance structure will use these private and public online platforms to spread narratives broadly in the hopes that they will influence the behavior of disaffected socially disconnected angry individuals. russia has been a particular concern for top officials. during her confirmation hearing in january director of national intelligence avril haines testified that the kremlin was using active measures against the political right and the political left to promote extremism in a sense. dni nominee haines says russia pushing on both us right left to promote extremism in a sense w their active measures . current and former officials as well as analysts have also warned russia is actively cultivating a new generation of influence peddlers focused on building followers among the far right and far left. as part of the new domestic terrorism strategy officials have pledged to find ways to counter the polarization often fueled by disinformation misinformation and dangerous conspiracy theories online supporting an information environment that fosters healthy democratic discourse according to a white house handout. officials also note that washington has joined the christchurch call to action to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online an initiative named after the new zealand city where a far right gunman killed 51 people at two mosques in 2019. but countering the threat from disinformation in particular will be difficult according to homeland security officials who point to the siege of the capitol on jan. 6 for which almost 500 people have been arrested. now what united all of those people asked cohen who noted many of those at the capitol that day were not affiliated with any groups. among other things they were all encouraged to come here by a disinformation narrative that the election was fraudulent and that had been stolen and that it was their responsibility to act he said. and officials worry the spread and influence of disinformation could soon get worse as adversaries whether countries or eventually criminal or terrorist networks gain access to artificial intelligence or ai. artificial intelligence could generate disinformation scale in a way that brings real concern anne neuberger white house deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology told a virtual forum last month.'

other,"a new analysis of blood samples from 24000 americans taken early last year is the latest and largest study to suggest that the new coronavirus popped up in the including five illinois cases in december 2019 weeks before cases were first recognized by health officials. the analysis is not definitive and some experts remain skeptical but federal health officials are increasingly accepting a timeline in which small numbers of covid 19 infections may have occurred in the before the world ever became aware of a dangerous new virus erupting in china. there was probably very rare and sporadic cases here earlier than we were aware of. but it was not widespread and didn t become widespread until late february said thornburg principal investigator of the cdc s respiratory virus immunology team. the pandemic coronavirus emerged in wuhan china in late 2019. officially the first infection to be identified was a traveler a washington state man who returned from wuhan on jan. cdc officials initially said the spark that started the outbreak arrived during a three week window from mid january to early february. but research since then including some done by the cdc has suggested a small number of infections occurred earlier. a cdc led study published in december 2020 that analyzed 7000 samples from american red cross blood donations suggested the virus infected some americans as early as the middle of december 2019. the latest study published tuesday online by the journal clinical infectious diseases is by a team including researchers at the national institutes of health. they analyzed blood samples from more than 24000 people across the country collected in the first three months of 2020 as part of a long term study called all of us that seeks to track 1 million americans over years to study health. like the cdc study these researchers looked for antibodies in the blood that are taken as evidence of coronavirus infection and can be detected as early as two weeks after a person is first infected. the researchers say nine study participants five from illinois and one each from massachusetts mississippi pennsylvania and wisconsin were infected earlier than any covid 19 case was ever reported in those states. the health report florida coronavirus newsletter . a daily update on the coronavirus crisis in florida. one of the illinois cases was infected as early as christmas eve said keri althoff an associate professor at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health and the study s lead author. it can be difficult to distinguish antibodies that neutralize sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 from antibodies that fight other coronaviruses including some that cause the common cold. researchers in both the nih and cdc studies used multiple types of tests to minimize false positive results but some experts say it still is possible their 2019 positives were infections by other coronaviruses and not the pandemic strain. while it is entirely plausible that the virus was introduced into the united states much earlier than is usually appreciated it does not mean that this is necessarily strong enough evidence to change how we re thinking about this said william hanage a harvard university expert on disease dynamics. the nih researchers have not followed up with study participants yet to see if any had traveled out of the prior to their infection. but they found it noteworthy that the nine did not live in or near new york city or seattle where the first wave of cases were concentrated. the question is how did and where did the virus take seed althoff said. the new study indicates it probably seeded in multiple places in our country she added. the associated press health and science department receives support from the howard hughes medical institute s department of science education. the ap is solely responsible for all """

labour,"financially beleaguered tower health which owns six hospitals in the philadelphia area reported progress in its turnaround during the first three months of this year. the nonprofit system based in berks county reduced its operating loss in the quarter to 80 million down from the 111 million loss in the last three months of 2020 according to its latest statement for bondholders. tower s interim chief executive sue perrotty who took that job after clint matthews abruptly retired in february told employees in a video message last month that the system s positive momentum has continued as more patients keep returning to its hospitals and doctors offices. our near term efforts to stabilize tower health are not yet complete and there is still hard work ahead but i believe we can begin to shift our focus to a new and brighter horizon she said. she assured employees in an email last week that tower is not preparing for bankruptcy. april was tower s first profitable month since october 2019 executives said. they did not provide recent details on its cash reserves which have been dwindling and are a concern to municipal bond investors. tower s troubles started long before the coronavirus pandemic pushed many health care businesses into the red as patients stayed away except for the most urgent needs. but even healthier systems are only slowly recovering from covid 19 impacts. doylestown health einstein health network jefferson health and main line health would still have had operating losses through nine months of fiscal 2021 were it not for the federal cares act grants meant to help hospitals through the crisis. children s hospital of philadelphia university of pennsylvania health system and temple university health system by contrast would have been profitable even without the grants. kaufmann hall a national consulting firm in chicago pointed to a choppy recovery for hospitals with april results worse than those in march based on results from over 900 hospitals. overall margins remain low and fluctuations month over month convey continued uncertainties for hospitals as they work to recover from a profoundly challenging pandemic said erik swanson a senior vice president of data and analytics at kaufman hall. long profitable and dominant in berks county where it owns reading hospital in west reading tower embarked on a dramatic expansion five years ago. that effort included the 423 million purchase in 2017 of five community hospitals brandywine jennersville phoenixville pottstown and chestnut hill. through march the group s operating losses have totaled 426 million since tower acquired them including 114 million so far in the current fiscal year. those and other losses have put pressure on the amount of cash tower has available to pay for daily expenses. in health care cash is measured by the absolute amount and also by how many days an organization can continue making payroll and paying vendors without new money. tower said that figure was 112 days of cash on march 31 down from 147 days on june 30. but that s not the whole story. some of that money must be repaid. tower told bondholders that it counted about 25 days of medicare cash advances about 166 million that it had to start repaying in april. excluding that money the number of days would be about 87. the number of days would be even lower if other money with strings attached such as payroll tax deferrals were excluded. tower said last summer that it had deferred 25 million in payroll taxes though june 30 but it did not update those deferrals in its most recent report. temple university health system told investors last month that it must repay 28 million in payroll tax deferrals. employers were allowed to do this to preserve cash during the pandemic. excluding temple s medicare advances would reduce its days of cash to 118 from 148 the system said. besides accepting federal help as most hospitals did tower has also used private means to boost liquidity. it raised about 200 million from a sale leaseback of 23 medical offices and other buildings last june. without that money its cash hoard of about 556 million according to fitch ratings analyst kevin holloran who excluded the medicare advances would be much lower. that money was a huge help to tower but the deal effectively added to the system s already large billion debt. tower s troubled expansion binge coupled with covid 19 forced the system last fall to start considering the sale of some or all of its properties. a few deadlines in the process have passed with no action. tower s board recently delayed a decision on whether to continue down that path until mid july.

arts,"paris google said it would make changes to its global advertising business to ensure it did not abuse its dominance bowing to antitrust pressure for the first time in a landmark settlement with french authorities. the deal with the french competition watchdog could help rebalance the power over advertising in favour of publishers which held sway over the business in the pre internet era but lost control with the rapid rise of google and facebook. the settlement which was announced on monday and also saw google fined 220 million euros 268 million is the first time the tech giant has agreed to make changes to its huge advertising business which brings in the bulk of its revenue. the decision to sanction google is of particular significance because it s the first decision in the world focusing on the complex algorithmic auction processes on which the online ad business relies said france s antitrust chief isabelle de silva. the watchdog found that google s ad management platform for large publishers google ad manager favoured the company s own online ad marketplace google adx where publishers sell space to advertisers in real time. ad manager provided adx with strategic data such as the winning bidding prices while adx also enjoyed privileged access to requests made by advertisers via google s ad services the authority said. adx in turn exchanged data more smoothly with ad manager than it did with other advertising management platforms the watchdog added. such platforms are crucial for publishers to manage and sell advertising space. under the terms of the settlement google made commitments to improve the way ad manager services worked with rival ad servers and ad space sales platforms the french watchdog said. some changes would be implemented by the first quarter of 2022 it said adding that google would not appeal the decision. google also said it had agreed to make it easier for publishers to use its data and tools. we will be testing and developing these changes over the coming months before rolling them out more broadly including some globally the company added. many publishers globally have been infuriated over ad practices employed by the tech giants whose success relies on the trove of data it has amassed over the years. most of google s sales come from search and youtube ads. but last year about 23 billion was tied to helping publishers sell ads drawing antitrust scrutiny to the connections between google s businesses plus calls from some critics to break up the sprawling company. french finance minister bruno le maire welcomed the antitrust decision. the practices put in place by google to favour its own advertising technologies have affected press groups whose business model is heavily dependent on ad revenues he said. the french authority said the decision opens the way for publishers who felt disadvantaged to seek damages from google. it launched its investigation in 2019 following a complaint from news corp. french news publishing group le figaro and belgian press group rossel. the three publishers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

canada pleaded guilty in the united states wednesday where he was caught when a state trooper pulled him over for speeding and found 67 guns and ammunition stuffed in his pickup truck. dayne adrian sitladeen 29 who is better known by his performing name yung lava drove fans crazy when dropping slickly produced new music videos while at the top of toronto police s most wanted list. he appeared in a 2019 documentary with hip hop star drake that decried the city s contagious gun violence which was the same year police announced he was a fugitive wanted for the shooting death of a man in a west toronto home. 10 when a minnesota state trooper stopped a rented pickup truck for speeding. the truck was going 95 to 100 miles per hour on interstate 94 which has a speed limit of 75 mph. inside the truck the trooper found 67 guns with magazines and ammunition including several high capacity magazines. troopers found that both occupants had crossed illegally into the united states and were wanted by police in ontario for serious charges. driving the truck was muzamil aden addow 29 one of four men accused in york region north of toronto for the bizarre kidnapping of a wealthy chinese student that made international headlines in 2019. both men initially pleaded not guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm by an alien illegally in the united states and they mounted a fierce legal fight in district of minnesota court. dayne adrian sitladeen left and muzamil aden addow. their lawyers filed a flurry of motions demanding evidence be rejected for unlawful search and seizure the suppression of statements made to police at the time of their arrests and at an interrogation the following day by a department of homeland security border patrol agent claimed violations of their constitutional rights and a motion to dismiss the charges outright saying the statute itself is unconstitutional. all but one of those motions were withdrawn and on wednesday afternoon sitladeen appeared in court to change his plea. how do you plead asked judge nancy brasel. plead guilty said sitladeen in a clear but quiet voice. he admitted to the guns in the truck and his unlawful status in the he told brasel he was a canadian citizen had completed his high school and could read write and speak english. he asked several questions clarifying the plea agreement which barsel took as a good sign. i m going to find you mentally competent she said while assessing his fitness to plead guilty. you ve asked good questions here today. i accept your plea and find you guilty as charged. the plea agreement does not guarantee a specific sentence which remains up to barsel to decide. the charge allows for a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a 250000 fine with no mandatory minimum. the sentencing guidelines calculated by prosecutors suggested a sentence of 70 to 87 months in prison and the defence calculated a range of 46 to 57 months. fugitives wanted in canada for murder found with an arsenal during traffic stop police say . chinese student taken in violent toronto area abduction on saturday found safe police . something closer to the lower range seems likely as a clause in the plea agreement states he retains the right to appeal if he is sentenced to more than 57 months. the plea agreement also recognized one pre trial challenge remained in play the challenge to the indictment itself meaning that if he wins a future court argument over the constitutionality of the law he could revisit his plea. there is no date set for that motion to be heard. brasel ordered a pre sentence investigation which will tell her more about his background and prospects including an interview of sitladeen his family and other research. a date was not set for the sentencing hearing. his pending charge in canada was not mentioned but it was likely the cause of the disputed range of recommended sentencing between the prosecutors and defence court heard they disagreed on the level

known for a lavish lifestyle including his lamborghini rolls royce and range rover. when he was grabbed he was wearing a 2000 gucci guccify hoodie circumstances that raised questions in china. addow s case is following a similar path to sitaleen s. his lawyers also withdrew a series of motions objecting to evidence in the case and the process of the prosecution. addow is scheduled for a change of

lifestyle,"ed perkins on travel airline voucher expiring ed perkins tribune content agency . jun 7 2021 updated 11 hrs ago . travel voucher text quote on notepad concept background. ed perkins tribune content agency . if you re one of the millions of frustrated travelers who had to cancel a trip because of covid 19 and accept a voucher instead of a refund from your airline help may be on the way. two key senators are in your corner as are most consumer advocates. and they re going to push the department of transportation to do something about it. the situation arose because of the way airline contracts of carriage and dot rules handle cancellations . when an airline cancels your flight it owes you a cash refund no matter how nonrefundable the ticket you bought. although few lines initially resisted cash refunds dot ruled firmly that they owed cash. but if you cancel before the airline cancels even if it s clear you wo n t be able to travel the airline owes you only what its contract says it will offer. typically at best that means the airline gives you a voucher you can apply to a future flight within a year or so. in the case of covid airlines say their voucher offers were generous because they could have enforced their hefty ticket change fees and in some cases even offered bupkes nonrefundable means nonrefundable. almost all such vouchers have a time limit and many are now about to expire. some lines have given short extensions but almost all covid vouchers are going to expire in a year or less. and clearly for a variety of reasons many of you are n t in a position to use them before then. many top consumer advocates have been promised a group meeting with secretary pete buttigieg and they re all focused on the voucher problem. some want as a minimum a mandatory extension of two years or more others want to go further and require cash refunds. in either case tackling this problem is an easy way for secretary buttigieg to score a popular win. meanwhile last may senators markey d mass and blumenthal d conn sent a letter to the presidents of the country s seven largest airlines urging that they voluntarily extend any pandemic related flight credits indefinitely. the airlines collective response was downright insulting instead of responding to the senators specific requests they had a4a their trade association send a vague letter fulsomely praising the airlines generosity in the face of financial adversity and ignoring the primary issue. that response also highlights the typical big airline approach to most consumer issues . even after an issue becomes an obvious consumer pain point one they could easily solve voluntarily they ignore it. when the pain becomes so severe that consumers demand government action and the government does take action they whine about excessive regulation. whether by legislation or dot rule my guess is that you ll see some action at least to preserve the value of any of your money the airlines are holding. even better you might even get your money back. in other airline news united airlines got a lot of pr mileage out of its announcement last week of ordering 15 boom overture supersonic jets. a few of my colleagues in the press took umbrage suggesting that united s ordering jets that would serve a tiny very upscale minority of travelers was a questionable use of government bail out funds. here i have to differ not that only the rich will ever fly supersonic but that united actually misused government money. although i have no inside information i would be very surprised if united has anything but a trivial amount of money up front. instead the most likely monetary consequence is that united s order will help boom find additional financing. as for supersonic flight i have to confess to conflicting emotions. i flew on the concorde twice never on any freebie but paying less than 5 percent of the posted fare and it was great. but even if boom makes all its projected performance as a value proposition supersonic flight will remain iffy for almost everybody. with a first flight in 2029 i do n t think i ll even try to get on it. send e mail to ed perkins at also

education,"since the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic canada s young people particularly young canadians with disabilities have been among the most affected. during national accessability week it is important to recognize the many contributions that canadians with disabilities have made and continue to make in our communities and to ensure that they have the tools they need to succeed now and into the future. june 3 2021 gatineau quebec employment and social development canada since the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic canada s young people particularly young canadians with disabilities have been among the most affected. during national accessability week it is important to recognize the many contributions that canadians with disabilities have made and continue to make in our communities and to ensure that they have the tools they need to succeed now and into the future. today the minister of employment workforce development and disability inclusion carla qualtrough announced 240000 in funding to the national educational association of disabled students neads for the virtual access for all program. this program is a two year project that will support students with disabilities so that they can successfully navigate the transition to post secondary education. with this funding neads will offer virtual mentoring and webinars on various topics related to accessibility as well as expand their national student awards program which provides scholarship awards to post secondary students with disabilities. students with disabilities often face systemic barriers to education which make it more challenging for them to complete their studies and may cause them to graduate with more debt. projects like this play an important role in ensuring students with disabilities can successfully complete their studies and be a part of an inclusive economic recovery for all canadians. this project adds to the investment made in budget 2021 to support students with disabilities. this includes the extension of disability supports under the canada student loans program to recipients whose disabilities are persistent or prolonged but not necessarily permanent. the change will benefit an estimated 40000 recipients with non permanent disabilities each year through access to up to 30000 in grants in study supports such as assistive services and equipment and specialized repayment assistance on their loans. removing barriers to accessibility and inclusion gives canadians with disabilities the opportunity to participate more fully in our communities helping our economy prosper so that all canadians benefit. post secondary education is an incredible opportunity that all canadians deserve the chance to pursue. that is why it is so important that we reduce the barriers for young canadians with disabilities as they make that transition. our government is proud to partner with organizations such as neads which ensure that students with disabilities can access the supports they need to complete their post secondary studies. we are all equal partners in canada s economic recovery and when every canadian has a fair chance at success we all benefit. minister of employment workforce development and disability inclusion carla qualtrough . we would like to thank minister qualtrough and employment and social development canada for supporting this important two year project. the board and staff of the national educational association of disabled students are excited to help disabled students in transition to college and university studies and in the critical early stage of their post secondary journey. a doubling of up front grants in the canada student loans program for disabled students this year and last and significant increases in funding and the duration of the canada summer jobs program also prove the government of canada is committed to accessible and affordable education and career related employment experiences for students and graduates with disabilities. the government of canada supports students in their academic careers through a variety of supports. this includes the canada education savings program the canada student loans program and the supports for student learning program. in addition the government has a number of programs targeted at persons with disabilities to help them manage the costs of completing their post secondary studies . students with a permanent disability who demonstrate financial need receive the canada student grant for students with permanent disabilities. the grant can be used to cover the costs of housing tuition and books. students with a permanent disability who require exceptional education related services or equipment such as tutors note takers interpreters or technical aids may be eligible to receive up to 20000 through the canada student grant for services and equipment for students with permanent disabilities. students with a permanent disability are also exempt from the fixed student contribution which requires students to contribute up to 3000 per year toward their education. the repayment assistance plan for borrowers with a permanent disability is available to canada student loan borrowers who have a permanent disability. this plan can reduce or replace the recipient s monthly student loan payment depending on their financial situation and ensures that the loan is fully paid off in 10 years. students who have a severe permanent disability that prevents them from achieving sufficiently gainful employment may be eligible to have their student loans forgiven through the severe permanent disability benefit. as of october 1 2020 canada student loan borrowers who need to withdraw temporarily from studies for medical or parental reasons including mental health reasons can receive up to 18 months of interest and payment free leave. these funds would support national and local after school organizations who work to ensure that vulnerable children and youth can graduate high school and do not become further marginalized because of the pandemic. every year the canada student loans program supports over 75000 students and borrowers with permanent disabilities through enhanced grants and repayment assistance. associated links .

adults with insomnia will be presented at sleep 2021. the annual joint meeting of the american academy of sleep medicine and the sleep research society is conducted virtually from june 10 13. antonio olivieri senior vice president head of global medical affairs of idorsia commented as a company with a strong scientific core rooted in innovative small molecules idorsia aims to transform the horizon of therapeutic options. we look forward to presenting new data from our phase 3 clinical program and other important new data on daridorexant. this reflects our commitment to advance research for insomnia a condition that can substantially impact the physical and mental health of patients and remains an area with great unmet need. posters for daridorexant include the following fietze i et al.

supplements supplement https supplements . daridorexant is currently investigational and is not approved for any use anywhere in the world. in march the us food and drug administration fda accepted a new drug application nda for review of daridorexant for the treatment of adult patients with insomnia. idorsia has also submitted marketing authorization applications maa to the european medicines agency and swissmedic for daridorexant for the same indication. notes to the editor about insomnia insomnia is defined as a combination of dissatisfaction with sleep and a significant negative impact on daytime functioning. dissatisfaction with sleep refers to the difficulty to initiate and or maintain sleep on at least three nights per week for at least three months despite adequate opportunity to sleep. insomnia is a condition of overactive wake signaling and studies have shown that areas of the brain associated with wakefulness remain more active during sleep in patients with insomnia. insomnia is a common problem with a prevalence of approximately 10 . on this basis and assuming a us adult population of around 250 million there are approximately 25 million adults in the us who suffer from insomnia. insomnia as a disorder is quite different from a brief period of poor sleep and it can take its toll on both physical and mental health. it is a persistent condition with a negative impact on daytime functioning. idorsia s research has shown that poor quality sleep can affect many aspects of daily life including the ability to concentrate mood and energy levels. the goals of managing insomnia are to improve sleep quality and quantity as well as daytime functioning. current recommended treatment of insomnia includes sleep hygiene recommendations cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy. about the orexin system wake and sleep signalling is regulated by intricate neural circuitry in the brain. one key component of this process is the orexin system which helps promote wakefulness. there are two forms of orexin neuropeptides small protein like molecules used by nerve cells neurons to communicate with each other in the brain orexin a and orexin b. orexin promotes wakefulness through its receptors ox1r and ox2r. together these neuropeptides and receptors make up the orexin system. the orexin system stimulates targeted neurons in the wake system leading to the release of several chemicals dopamine serotonin histamine acetylcholine norepinephrine which promote wakefulness. under normal circumstances orexin levels rise throughout the day as wakefulness is promoted and then fall at night. overactivity of the wake system is an important driver of insomnia. about daridorexant daridorexant is an investigational dual orexin receptor antagonist dora designed and developed for the treatment of insomnia. daridorexant reduces overactive wakefulness associated with insomnia by blocking the activity of orexin. doras specifically target the orexin system by competitively binding with both receptors thereby reversibly blocking the activity of orexin. blocking orexin receptors reduces the downstream activity of the wake promoting neurotransmitters that are overactive in insomnia. about the registration program the phase 3 registration program comprised two three month studies together with a long term double blind extension study. both pivotal studies are complete having enrolled around 1850 patients with insomnia at over 160 sites across 18 countries. as insomnia often presents later in life and elderly patients are more susceptible to fragmented sleep early awakening and daytime sleepiness around 40 of the recruited population was aged 65 years or older. the placebo controlled studies investigated the effects of three doses of daridorexant 10 mg 25 mg and 50 mg on sleep and daytime functioning parameters objectively in a sleep lab by polysomnography and subjectively with a daily patient diary at home. the impact of insomnia on patients daytime functioning was measured daily using the sleepiness domain score from the insomnia daytime symptoms and impacts questionnaire idsiq a patient reported outcome pro instrument validated according to fda industry guidance. both phase 3 studies met their primary endpoints and the results were first presented in a late breaking oral presentation at the associated professional sleep societies apss sleep 2020 medical congress in august 2020. more than 800 patients continued treatment into a 40 week extension study which measured the effects of all three doses vs placebo generating data for long term treatment of insomnia. about idorsia idorsia ltd is reaching out for more we have more ideas we see more opportunities and we want to help more

weather,"in the spring of 2021 the vernadsky research base a ukrainian antarctic station was equipped with an ajax security system featuring fireprotect and fireprotect plus fire detectors. the ajax equipment was delivered at a distance of 16 thousand kilometers that protects the scientific base in antarctica. from this article one will learn how to install a fire alarm system at a facility if that facility is a polar station. presence of previous fire alarm . for the first 10 years the base was used by british polar explorers. at the time the base was called faraday and belonged to the united kingdom. since then it changed its name flag and country but not its fire detection equipment. the old system malfunctioned and caused false alarms. some detectors were inoperable. but finding spare parts for them and bringing them to antarctica was becoming more difficult. antarctica is the windiest place on earth where hurricane force winds blow most of the time. even a tiny flame can quickly turn into a large blaze. a fire alarm is chosen based on its communication reliability maintenance fire alert and climate impact . some detectors were inoperable. but finding spare parts for them and bringing them to antarctica was becoming more difficult. what happens if there is a fire . antarctica is the windiest place on earth where hurricane force winds blow most of the time. even a tiny flame can quickly turn into a large blaze. a fire alarm is chosen based on its communication reliability maintenance fire alert and climate impact . most of the buildings at antarctic stations were built decades ago. these are often small wooden houses with metal panels insulated with foam. when the foam burns it releases the deadly phosgene gas. in 2020 there was a short circuit at the russian mirny station. the fire burned down laboratories the radio room and other buildings. criteria to choose an alarm system . the following is considered while choosing an alarm system . communication reliability the station is a complex of buildings so it is important to cover them with one system. for this the most reliable radio communication with a long range is required. maintenance one can t invite a professional installer to a station in antarctica the station engineers maintain the system themselves. it mustn t require a lot of attention. devices must operate from batteries for years and instantly alert if something goes wrong. for example if a detector loses connection or if batteries need to be replaced in a couple of months. fire alert there is a person at the station who monitors the system. you need a system with a handy alarm monitoring app for pcs as well as loud sirens to alert people to danger. limate impact during the cold season the temperature outside drops to 27 c. in residential premises it is kept at 16 18 c and in non residential ones it is kept with a slight plus . the specifications of the detectors must correspond to these conditions. why ajax . the policy of the antarctic center is to buy ukrainian. and only buy the best you can t economize on antarctica. the price of failure is very high and shipping costs a lot of money. a marker was triggered if a security system then ajax. and we were not mistaken with the choice said viacheslav marchenko deputy director of the national antarctic scientific center nasc . in addition to the hub the security system control panel and two sirens ten ajax fire detectors were delivered to galindez island in west antarctica. they protect against fire detect smoke and rapid temperature swings and prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. when connected to the ajax security system via the secure jeweller radio protocol the detectors can operate at distances of up to 1300 meters from the hub. ajax fire detectors will do the job even if the station loses access to the internet or there is no one to monitor alarms. the devices can operate independently from the system control panel. even if there will be no connection with the hub detectors will recognize the threat and the built in sirens will alert the danger. the siren volume is 85 db to wake up even those who fast asleep. ajax will also handle it when the temperature in the station premises drops to 11 12 c happens when there are strong winds . the detector s operating temperature ranges from 0 c to 65 c. operation period . the siren volume is 85 db to wake up even those who fast asleep. works at varying temperatures . ajax will also handle it when the temperature in the station premises drops to 11 12 c happens when there are strong winds . the detector s operating temperature ranges from 0 c to 65 c. finally there is no need to worry about how frequently one has to send new batteries to the station. the autonomous operation period of the detectors is up to 4 years. bring equipment to antarctica . it took three planes one ship and about seven days to get them to antarctica. five of those were spent traveling by ship which crossed the stormiest place on the planet the drake passage. each polar explorer brings three bags two with their own stuff and one shared. ajax was delivered in such a bag. ajax devices work out of the box they connect to a hub in one tap in the apps and mount in a few minutes . ajax devices work out of the box the battery is already pre installed and the detectors don t need to be disassembled. they connect to a hub in one tap in the apps and mount in a few minutes on a smartbracket. working of station alarm monitoring . the station uses the computer with the pro desktop app installed. a screen with all the indicators is placed in the lobby of the main building. another computer in the on duty person s office is used as an alarm monitoring station. to manage the system on the go station engineers have ajax apps on their smartphones. the station has internet but it became unlimited only this spring after installing a satellite antenna. during the two months of operation there were two alarms at the station in the kitchen when the polar explorers were grilling steaks and in the carpentry shop where welding work was taking place. in both cases the equipment responded to the smoke. the plan is to install 20 more fire detectors at the station as well as to supplement the ajax system with the rex radio signal range extender. the polar station consists of 12 buildings including living quarters a carpentry workshop and a boathouse located at a distance from each other. the buildings are covered with profiled iron which can interfere with the radio signal. the range extender will increase the reach of the devices and become a reliable link between the detectors and the hub. schools present unique challenges for security and access control. but what about a school that is also a heritage site of exceptional value the colegio diocesano santo domingo in orihuela spain is more than just a school. its historic buildings date to the 1500s a heritage site as well as a place of learning with a museum that requires the protection of the same access system. the college buildings are a resource of cultural interest and on spain s heritage registry they must not be damaged. wire free electronic locks were the obvious answer. a wireless solution smartair wireless locking devices now control access through 300 doors around the school. electronic escutcheons knob cylinders and wall readers including lifts are connected to intuitive smartair software by a network of 38 hubs. the school chose smartair wireless online management for their new keyless access system. this powerful management option enables real time control of access to and around the site even if the school s data network is down. automated emails inform security staff of any incidents keeping students teachers equipment and precious heritage safe. real time key management the main benefit is the ease of real time key management from any place and at any time via the wireless online management system says the school s it manager francisco fern ndez soriano. this increases security for children and for staff because no unauthorised people can enter the school. in addition to the main entrances and classrooms access to private spaces is constantly monitored in addition to the main entrances and classrooms access to private spaces such as lifts offices staff rooms the church the museum the library and the it room is constantly monitored. scalable modular system installation of the school s smartair system required minimal work. some doors date to the 16th century so major alterations were not possible. the system was installed without a hitch and also without any disruption to classes he adds. because smartair is a modular system scalability is built in. they can extend or fine tune their access system when they choose. indeed the school s smartair phase ii is already under discussion.""

politics,"toronto june 07 2021 globe newswire montero mining and exploration ltd. tsx v mon montero or the company has mapped an area of extensive quartz veins in the newly staked isabella oriental concession block. mapping has also been extended to the docamavida area south of isabella where a new style of gold occurrence has been discovered. both areas are outside of the target areas undergoing drill testing by the company. dr tony harwood president of montero commented i am pleased to confirm by mapping an extensive vein system identified in recently staked isabella oriental area to the east of the current drilling program. our mapping has also discovered a new gold occurrence associated with tourmaline breccia dykes in the docamavida area to the south. the mapping confirms that granite hosted gold silver mineralized quartz veins extend along the entire 12 kilometers of the southern granite sediment contact in the isabella district. the company has completed a detailed mapping program in select areas to better understand the occurrences of mineralized quartz veins and their spatial association within and adjacent to leucogranite figure 1 . the mapping has identified a narrow 200 m band of volcanic rocks that extends in an east west direction adjacent to the southern contact of the isabella granite. the volcanic unit is host to numerous gossan breccia boulders that occur south of the isabella east property and which have been previously described by the company. isabella oriental detailed map area the mapping has identified numerous structurally controlled quartz veins that are spatially associated with a leucogranite phase of the isabella granite. previous sampling of the veins prior to montero reported assays up to g t au and 19 g t ag. two dominant quartz vein systems are identified a km long north east trending vein array and a 1 km long north south trending vein array. individual quartz veins are up to 3 m in width. mapping has also confirmed the extent of volcanic rocks within the metasediments along the southern contact of the isabella granite pluton. quartz veins have been identified within the volcanics and also in metasediment adjacent to the leucogranite and represent exploration targets for potential au ag mineralized quartz veins. docamavida map area the docamavida area is located south of the mataquito river figure 1 and was the site of historical mining activity. previous exploration prior to the acquisition by montero identified abundant quartz boulders at surface and also quartz veins within granitic rock figure 3 . reported assays of exposed veins range up to g t au and 12 g t ag with high concentrations of arsenic of up to 3000 ppm as. the isabella veins to the north in contrast contain very low as concentration. the quartz veins at docamavida display massive to breccia textures with evidence of repeated faulting along vein margins. individual veins are up to m in width and up to 100 m in strike length. veins have a lenticular morphology and form part of a more extensive extensional vein system. mapping confirmed the presence of historical mine pits and exposed quartz veins. the veins are controlled within north east structures and occur within a leucogranite similar to that described in the isabella area to the north and also within fault zones along the contact with metasediment inliers figure 4 . samples of quartz veins collected by montero from a fault zone assayed up to g t au and 1144 ppm as. the mapping also discovered an area of quartz tourmaline breccia dykes in the southern part of the property for which samples collected by montero assayed up to g t au and 183 ppm bi. montero will continue to evaluate areas of the isabella properties as part of a district wide resource assessment. summary the detailed mapping provides for some important exploration assumptions. based on the recent mapping the volcanic and granite rocks defined at isabella post date formation of the triassic sediments. both rock types are interpreted to have developed during the jurassic to cretaceous periods. previous mapping by munoz 1995 reported that similar volcanics near the town of hualane to be of upper jurassic age and coeval with a series of small intermediate intrusive bodies that occur within volcanics. as such an assumed early to mid jurassic age for the volcanic linear mapped along the southern contact at isabella is consistent with the munoz interpretation. the interpretation of a roof pendant of meta sediments and volcanics within the leucogranite in isabella oriental indicates the granite pluton to be younger than both rock types. field relationships also suggest the leucogranite phase formed within an upper part of the granite pluton and could be a younger more differentiated phase of the isabella granite. the spatial association of au ag mineralized quartz veins with intermediate felsic intrusive and volcanics of jurassic to later cretaceous age have been documented in the talca area to the south east where the chepica au ag cu mine occurs and also to the north near rancagua where yamana operates the minera florida mine. these observations indicate that further exploration is warranted in the isabella district which has similar geological features. qualified person statement this press release was reviewed and approved by mr. mike evans nat. who is a qualified person for the purpose of national instrument 43 101 and a consulting geologist to montero. a review was also undertaken by sr. marcial vergara who is resident of chile and a qualified person for the purpose of national instrument 43 101 and a technical advisor to montero. sr. vergara has extensive experience in gold exploration in chile. about montero

health,"graves of people who had recently died due to the coronavirus disease covid 19 are seen at the cemetery of nembro near bergamo italy may 13 2020. samples from a study suggesting the coronavirus was circulating outside china by october 2019 have been re tested at the world health organization s wto request two scientists who led the italian research said. there is growing international pressure to learn more about the origins of the pandemic that has killed more than 3 million people worldwide and president joe biden last week ordered his aides to find answers. the who reacted to biden s announcement that intelligence agencies were pursuing rival theories including the possibility of a laboratory accident in china by saying the search was being poisoned by politics . read more . covid 19 was first identified in the central chinese city of wuhan in december 2019 while italy s first patient was detected on feb. 21 last year in a small town near milan. however a study published last year suggested antibodies to either the virus or a variant were detected in italy in 2019. that prompted chinese state media to suggest the virus might not have originated in china although the italian researchers stressed the findings raised questions about when the virus first emerged rather than where. the who asked us if we could share the biological material and if we could re run the tests in an independent laboratory. we accepted giovanni apolone scientific director of one of the lead institutions the milan cancer institute int said. who is in contact with the researchers that had published the original paper. a collaboration with partner laboratories has been set up for further testing a who spokesman said. the spokesman said the who was aware that the researchers are planning to publish a follow up report in the near future . he said the un agency has contacted all researchers who have published or provided information on samples collected in 2019 that were reported to have tested positive for sars cov 2 but does not yet have the final interpretation of the results. the italian researchers findings published by the int s scientific magazine tumori journal showed neutralising antibodies to sars cov 2 in blood taken from healthy volunteers in italy in october 2019 during a lung cancer screening trial. most of the volunteers were from lombardy the northern region around milan which was the first and hardest hit by the virus in italy. none of the studies published so far have ever questioned the geographical origin apolone told reuters. the growing doubt is that the virus probably less powerful compared to later months was circulating in china long before the reported cases apolone added. the who chose the laboratory of the erasmus university in rotterdam for the re test emanuele montomoli co author of the original study and professor of public health at the molecular medicine department in the university of siena said. the erasmus university did not reply to requests for comment. italian researchers sent the team in rotterdam 30 biological samples from october december 2019 that they had found positive 30 samples from the same period they had tested negative and 30 samples from as far back as 2018 negative. we sent them blind that means our colleagues did not know which samples were positive and which negative apolone said. they rechecked our samples with commercial tests which are much less sensitive than the ones we devised and validated montomoli said. despite the differences in the two detection methods both italian scientists said they were satisfied with the results delivered to them in late february adding that they could not comment further until the team of italian and dutch scientists have published their findings. we did not say in our study that we could establish without a doubt that the coronavirus later sequenced in wuhan was already circulating in italy in october montomoli said. we only found the response to the virus namely the antibodies. so we can say that this coronavirus or a very similar one perhaps a less transmissible variant was circulating here in october he added.

about it. in the sydney market last week only two fm stations experienced an increased share both of which were starting from a pretty low base. the bump for triple j tends to come alongside its janaury based hottest 100 countdown. the rest is a little more difficult to explain. on the australian radio network arn kiis fell points to a share and wsfm was down to things were even more dramatic for kiis in the demos with the station losing points in people aged 18 to 24 down to an share from and shedding a further points in 25 to 39s down to breakfast was also not immune with the seemingly

humanInterest,"as a long awaited memorial to the late bill j. mckown a gazebo in the middle of the great bend brit spaugh zoo was dedicated thursday morning. the ceremony came as part of the great bend chamber of commerce coffee hosted by the zoological society. the white structure located between the alligator pond and the fish pond stood out from the shaded lush green surroundings as folks gathered in the tropical humidity to honor mckown who died in march 2014. although he became a quadriplegic at age 19 after an august 1975 traffic crash near fresno calif. the lifetime great bend resident remained active in the community. it s taken years to get this accomplished but it is a suitable and fitting memorial to bill said robert feldt a member of the friends of bill mckown memorial committee who called mckown one of his heros. i am very pleased we finally have done it. and he added mckown loved zoos. i believe bill would have approved. despite the wheelchair bill lived an extraordinary life a heroic life feldt said. he lived that life in service to others and his community never letting the disability hinder his mind or spirit. another longtime friend chet cale said he grew up with mckown and knew him before the crash. he recalled boyhood pranks and playing flag football. then he passed around a photo of mckown at a boy scout camp prior to being injured. last to speak was mckown s oldest brother david. he told of a young vibrant mckown who wanted to become an artist but who evolved into the civic leader he became. the large crowd included zoo society members zoo staff chamber representatives city officials community members and friends and family of mckown. even a family of canada geese wandered by. feldt said the committee raised the money to build the gazebo which was considered a fitting tribute to mckown. the structure is handicap accessible built so two people in wheelchairs could enter and sit side by side. a plaque off the back side features mckown s photo and a biographical sketch of him. work started on the gazebo last year with the pouring of the concrete pad but it was slowed by the covid 19 pandemic. purchased from sturdi bilt of hutchinson brentwood builders of great bend assembled and installed it this spring. feldt first discussed this project with the zoo supervisor and great bend zoological board of directors in 2019. then zoo supervisor sara hamlin said a gazebo could replace the dock that was removed in 2017 after it had rusted and fallen into disrepair. the dock was installed in the 1990s and was a popular spot in the zoo where people could watch or feed the carp in the pond. after plans for a statue in the barton county courthouse square fell through hamlin suggested the gazebo. feldt also serves on the zoo society s board of directors something his friend mckown talked him into doing and found members were open to the idea of a gazebo where families could sit to watch and feed the fish in the pond. mckown s disability didn t stop him from living a more than full life friends said. he was scoutmaster of boy scout troop 155 held many positions at the prestigious national boy scout philmont ranch in new mexico and received numerous scouting awards. mckown served as the kansas delegate to the president s commission for the handicapped. he also devoted his time and talents to the kiwanis club great bend jaycees barton county arts council great bend zoological society great bend chamber of commerce united way of central kansas cheyenne bottoms relay for life of barton county panther booster club and cougar booster club. the zoo and other groups will receive financial gifts in perpetuity through his endowments to the golden belt community """

politics,"report blames poor welds for mexico city subway collapse . file in this may 4 2021 file photo subway cars dangle at an angle from a collapsed elevated section of the metro in mexico city the day after the collapse. a preliminary report on june 16 2021 by experts into the collapse that killed 26 people placed much of the blame on poor welds in studs that joined steel support beams to a concrete layer supporting the trackbed. mexico city ap a preliminary report by experts into the collapse of a mexico city elevated subway line that killed 26 people placed much of the blame wednesday on poor welds in studs that joined steel support beams to a concrete layer supporting the track bed. the city government hired norwegian certification firm dnv to study the possible causes of the may 3 accident in which a span of the elevated line buckled to the ground dragging down two subway cars. the report also said there were apparently not enough studs and the concrete poured over them may have been defective the welds between stretches of steel beams also appear to have been badly done. the studs showed deficiencies in the welding process the report states. the existence of construction defects when the line was built between 2010 and 2012 could be a major blow to the political career of mexico s top diplomat who was mayor at the time and to mexico s richest man whose company built part of the subway line. the report centered on photos and physical inspection that showed that metal studs welded to the top of steel support beams had broken or sheered off cleanly suggesting the welds were defective. the beams could not carry the weight of the track bed on their own. the studs projecting upward from the beams were covered with a poured concrete slab meant to help carry the weight. but the studs were found to be still carrying ceramic rings that covered the welds. used as a safety and control method to contain the molten steel the rings were supposed to have been knocked off after welding so inspectors could see the welds themselves. the fact they were left in place may suggest the welds were not properly inspected. that would fit in with reports that the project was rushed to completion so the number 12 subway line could be inaugurated by current foreign relations secretary marcelo ebrard before he left office as mayor in 2012. the section was built by a company owned by telecom and construction magnate carlos slim currently mexico s richest man and once the world s wealthiest. slim is an engineer by training and his firms are currently involved in building some parts of the controversial maya train project which will circle the yucatan peninsula. any suggestions his firm did shoddy work on the subway would be a serious blow to his reputation as a sort of elder statesman of the mexican business community. the billion number 12 line the newest section of a vast subway system opened in 1969 was ill fated from the start. the so called gold line cost half again as much as projected suffered repeated construction delays and was hit with allegations of design flaws corruption and conflicts of interest. a top executive of one of the companies that built it was the brother of the man who oversaw the project for the government. the scandal over forced closure of the costly new line in 2014 just 17 months after it was inaugurated essentially forced ebrard into political exile. he was rescued by his patron new president andr s manuel l pez obrador who had helped make him mayor in 2006 and resuscitated him by naming him foreign relations secretary in 2018. despite the subway scandal ebrard was put in charge of mexico s efforts to obtain coronavirus vaccines and was considered a top contender to succeed l pez obrador in 2024. ebrard has said he ll cooperate with investigations into last month s accident. previous reports by engineering firms revealed ebrard s city government had made a series of startlingly wrong choices when the subway line was designed and built. experts said unusually sharp curves in the route exacerbated problems with the wheels on steel track design which more resembles new york s subway rather than the european style rubber tires used on the rest of the system. the gold line line chattered bumped and shrieked. the rails began to take on a wavy pattern. drivers had to slow trains to as little as 3 mph 5 kph on some stretches. in 2014 the gold line had to be shut down for months for the tracks to be replaced or ground into shape. ballast was added between the train s tracks during those repairs and some say extra weight and possible poor maintenance could have been potential factors in the collapse. an official 2017 survey of damage caused by a deadly magnitude quake showed indications of construction defects. authorities decided on quick patches welding props under the bowed beams and reopening service. ebrard has argued that subsequent investigations showed the line was judged to comply with standards when it was built. he wrote that the supervision and maintenance that was up to the administration that succeeded mine remains in large part an unknown. following earlier investigations into the design and corruption more than 38 government employees were hit with fines or other punishments for improperly contracting out work on the train as well as some criminal charges. since the may accident much of the line has been closed. the elevated portion of the tracks rise about 16 feet 5 meters above a median strip and roadway in the poor southern borough of tlahuac. slender reinforced concrete columns are topped by horizontal steel beams which in turn support prefabricated concrete track beds on which gravel railway ties and tracks are laid. mexico city s subway which serves million riders every day has never had the one thing it needs most money. with ticket prices stuck at 25 cents per ride one of the lowest rates in

religion,"arlington va. the four bottles were buried together in a pit near the fireplace in the quarters of the enslaved maid servant. part of the dirt floor had been excavated and the bottles each one different had been placed side by side all pointing north toward freedom. a bone fragment from a goat or a sheep had been placed inside one. outside stood arlington house with its glittering dining room and columned portico overlooking the plantation the potomac river and the unfinished washington monument in the distance. two ways of life one of freedom and privilege the other of bondage and symbols buried in the earth by the fireplace. on tuesday the historic mansion in arlington national cemetery reopens after a renovation that has recaptured the glory of the house along with clues to the secret lives of the enslaved black people who were the main occupants of the land where it stood. even as experts gathered mementos of confederate gen. robert e. lee who lived in the house and his father in law george washington parke custis who had it built they found the mysterious folk elements buried by the enslaved. the discovery is rare and the first of its kind at arlington said matthew virta a national park service archaeologist and cultural resources manager. more than 100 black people lived at arlington over the years while about a dozen white people did. the bottles were probably placed around the 1850s virta said. enslaved people had been held at arlington for decades and had built the house. several had tried to escape but were caught brought back and whipped. these can be called conjure bottles if you will he said. a lot of folks are familiar with the term witching bottle where there s actually things inside the bottles . meaning different things. that has carried through the ages. the meaning of the animal bone in what may have been a large ink bottle is unknown virta said. there could be some residue and perhaps dna. but that s a long shot he said. we may never know exactly why virta said. it may have a ritual connection to african traditions of burying sacred objects in what is essentially a type of shrine. the three year arlington restoration was funded through the national park foundation with a million donation from washington area billionaire philanthropist and businessman david m. rubenstein. they did a spectacular job rubenstein said last week. i ve seen restorations over the years and rehabilitations of historic homes but this is one of the best. masonry fireplaces and floors have been repaired. interior walls have been repainted. shutters windows and doors have been restored. the site s two outbuildings where the enslaved lived have been restored to their original design and doors windows and exterior stucco have been rehabilitated. and the park service has gathered in new museum spaces artifacts representing the black and white families that shared arlington for three generations. the witching bottles which are still being studied and are not yet on display were unearthed in the spring of 2019 in the dwelling occupied by the family of selena norris gary the maid servant of mary anna randolph custis lee. mary anna lee the daughter of the elder custis was the wife of robert e. lee the famous army officer who ran the plantation after custis died and later joined the confederate rebellion. gray would become a key figure in the story of the house protecting precious artifacts after the lees vacated arlington during the 1861 1865 civil war and the site was occupied by union soldiers. the army later turned the plantation into the famous cemetery that now surrounds the house. among the lee pieces to be displayed is a draft of the letter written in arlington house eight days after the war began in which he resigned from army. a native of virginia and a highly regarded career officer he had been offered command of the forces according to the park service. save in defense of my native state shall i ever again draw my sword he wrote. also on exhibit are lee s chess set a lock of his hair a piece from the mane of his horse traveller and a revolver engraved with his name given to him by the faculty of the military academy at west point where he was superintendent from 1852 to 1855. in another museum space is a hand bell probably used to call in workers an african style mortar and pestle to grind herbs and spices and a fireplace tool from the gray family s hearth. there is also a letter written from arlington by now free selena gray to her former mistress mary anna lee in lexington va. seven years after the war. the place is changed so you would hardly know it gray wrote. she included a memento a rose bud that mary lee had planted on the grave of her mother who had died at arlington almost 20 years before. the house was constructed between 1802 and 1818 on an 1100 acre plantation. it was built with handmade brick and covered with cement. it was then painted and scored to look like marble and sandstone. it has eight 23 foot tall columns that are five feet in diameter at the bottom. the elder custis who had it built was the grandson of martha washington from her first marriage. after his father died in 1781 he was brought to mount vernon where he was raised as a son by george and martha washington. he grew to idolize george washington and had arlington built in

labour,"as many as 18 people have died from a june 7 fire at an svs aqua technologies chemical plant located in the pirangut industrial zone some 40 kilometres from pune the second largest city in the western indian state of maharashtra. the plant produces chlorine dioxide for water purification. the fire broke out during plastic packing said devendra potphode the chief fire officer for the pune metropolitan region development authority fire services. smoke was so much that female workers could not find an escape. it took several hours for the bodies of the victims all charred beyond recognition to be located and sent to sassoon general hospital for identification and post mortems. under conditions of mounting anger among the plant s workers and the families of the dead the local police filed a fir first investigation report against the ceo of the company on june 7 and arrested its owner nikunj shah the following day on charges of culpable homicide. preliminary investigations have pointed to criminal negligence on the part of management with flammable materials stored without following prescribed safety norms. the maharashtra state government which is a three party coalition led by the fascistic shiv sena and that includes the congress party and a regional off shoot from it the nationalist congress party ncp has announced an ex gratia payment of 500000 rupees us 6828 to the families of each of the deceased. in announcing the payment the state s deputy chief minister ajit pawar of the ncp said an expert committee has been designated to ascertain the cause of the fire and assign any responsibility for it. india s far right bharatiya janata party bjp led central government has announced 200000 rupees compensation for the kin of each of the deceased and 50000 rupees for the injured. pained by the loss of lives due to a fire at a factory in pune maharashtra. condolences to the bereaved families tweeted prime minister narendra modi. the tragic loss of life and terrible injuries among the svs aqua technologies workers are a direct result of the callous indifference of company management and both state and central governments to worker safety. modi s government in which the shiv sena served as a junior partner until november 2019 has relentlessly attacked workers rights including by further weakening india s notoriously lax environmental and occupational health and safety laws. the loss of life from the pune factory fire comes on top of the deaths of thousands on a daily basis due to the covid 19 pandemic which fueled by the highly contagious and more lethal delta variant continues to rage across india. although the authorities are now reporting less than 100000 new infections per day india is still recording nearly 4000 deaths daily even according to the official figures which are almost universally acknowledged to be a vast undercount. maharashtra reported a seven day average of over 11000 new covid 19 cases per day last week with a percent case fatality rate. modi s real concern is that the factory fire disaster will undermine his government s demand that workers return to their jobs amid a still raging pandemic risking their lives and those of their loved ones. even when india was averaging more than 400000 new cases daily in the second week of may the hindu supremacist bjp government was adamant that it would fulfill modi s april 20 vow to save india from lockdown not the pandemic. citing the recent fall in cases modi for several weeks now has been urging those state governments that did enact partial lockdown measures while leaving most industrial production to continue operating at full tilt to quickly remove them. the pune factory explosion and fire is just one of many thousands of examples of major capitalist corporations sacrificing workers lives and forcing them to use hazardous materials and dilapidated machinery with little to no safety equipment or training so as to maintain production and maximize profits. last year as india reopened from the modi government s ruinous ill prepared covid 19 lockdown there was a series of major industrial accidents due to companies failure to carry out proper inspection and maintenance before resuming or accelerating the pace of their operations. these include a toxic gas leak at an lg polymers plant in andhra pradesh on may 7 2020 which killed 11 and made more than 1000 sick a june 3 boiler explosion at yashashvi raasayan private limited s dahej gujarat facility that killed at least eight people and injured some 40 and boiler explosions at neyveli lignite corporation s thermal power plant in tamil nadu on may 7 and again on july 1 that killed at least 20 workers. according to labour and employment ministry data 3562 workers died in factory accidents in india between 2014 and 2016 and more than 51000 were injured during the same period an average of three deaths and 47 injuries every single day. a 2017 study by the british safety council painted a far bleaker picture reporting that 48000 workers die of occupational accidents in india every year. successive indian governments have worked to transform the country into a cheap labor haven for giant multinational corporations and international investors who have systematically neglected workers health and safety while reaping billions in profits. although central and state government authorities have worked with employers to cover up the number of covid 19 workplace infections and deaths during india s devastating second wave of the pandemic reports suggest that the deaths number in the thousands if not tens of thousands. late last month major automakers in the southern state of tamil nadu including ford india hyundai and renault nissan were forced to idle their operations in the face of protests and strikes by workers outraged over the lack of protection from covid 19.

weather,"england with up to 96 of new cases estimated to be the delta variant  should be ringing alarm bells ahead of lockdown being lifted  ministers are being warned. the latest figures from public health england phe   published on friday  show that 42 323 cases of the delta variant first identified in india have been confirmed in the uk  up by 29 892 from last week. it estimates that the strain is 60 more transmissible compared with the previously dominant alpha  or kent  variant  and that cases are doubling every four and a half days in some parts of england. the all party parliamentary group appg on coronavirus chairwoman layla moran said the figures should set alarm bells ringing in government . the lib dem mp added these figures should set alarm bells ringing in government as we approach june 21. the government must immediately explain to the public whether this exponential growth suggests the country is in line for a severe third wave  and if so what it is doing to prevent this. meanwhile  labour warned that the pace of the variant s spread put the potential lifting of lockdown restrictions at risk. shadow home secretary nick thomas symonds said the pace at which cases of the delta variant continue to rise is deeply worrying and is putting the lifting of restrictions at risk. the pace at which cases of the delta variant continue to rise is deeply worrying and is putting the lifting of restrictions at risk . the blame for this lies with the prime minister and his reckless refusal to act on labour s repeated warnings to secure our borders against covid and its variants. however  downing street has defended its borders policy in relation to the delta variant. asked whether boris johnson regretted not putting india on the red list of travel restrictions sooner the prime minister s spokesman said i would point to the tough border measures that we ve had in place for a fair amount of time now  that we ve ensured that anybody arriving from india needed to quarantine at home  and then later as you said they were put on the red list which means that people have to quarantine in a hotel if they arrive in the uk from india. their comments come after the times reported ministers are considering a four week delay to what some are calling freedom day   in order to give businesses certainty and allow more time for people to receive both vaccine doses. boris johnson is due to make a decision shortly on whether england can go ahead with full reopening  with an announcement expected on monday. the prime minister is being urged to err on the side of caution and delay the next stage of his road map as new figures show cases rising across england. the latest office for national statistics ons figures estimate that around one in 560 people in private households in england had covid 19 in the week to june 5  up from one in 640 in the previous week and the highest level since april 10. phe said that growth rates for delta cases are high across all parts of england  with regional estimates for doubling time ranging from days to days. as of june 7 there have been 42 deaths in england of people who were confirmed as having the delta variant of covid 19 and who died within 28 days of a positive test  23 of which were unvaccinated. the figures also showed that two thirds of the 1 234 people who attended a e in england between february 1 and june 7 and who were confirmed as having the delta variant of coronavirus were unvaccinated. of the 383 cases where attendance at a e resulted in an overnight admission  251 66 were unvaccinated. vaccines minister nadhim zahawi stressed the importance of being really careful in lifting coronavirus restrictions and urged against squander ing those hard fought gains made by the vaccination programme. during a broadcast round on friday morning  mr zahawi emphasised that the virus hasn t gone away when asked about reports of a delay. there have been some really hard won battles against this virus and we don t want to squander those hard fought gains that we have made through the vaccination programme  he told times radio breakfast. in saying that  the virus hasn t gone away  the virus will continue to attempt to mutate  to escape  to try and survive  and i think it s really important that we are really careful. mr zahawi said the government was on track to meet a target of all over 50s being offered their second jab by june 21  as he appealed to those who had not had a first dose to come forward to be vaccinated. reports of a four week delay to june 21 were welcomed by jim mcmanus  vice president of the association of directors of public health  who is warning that lifting restrictions risks cases and hospital admissions rising further. mr mcmanus told bbc radio 4 s today programme if you get enough people infected  you will get a rise in hospitalisations. you will also get a significant rise in long covid  which is something we want to avoid too. the second thing is that the more people infected  the more variants will develop  and the more risk we have that a variant will develop that evades the vaccine completely.'

science,"many a coffee connoisseur has wandered into a cafe or local coffee shop watched those little brown beans tumble and toast and thought i could do that. and since many shops sell raw green coffee beans right off the shelf it s easy for temptation to triumph. with the right tools the proper application of heat and finely tuned senses home roasting is an art achievable by any caffeinated individual willing to give it a shot. but don t discount the science and technique that goes into roasting your own beans or you risk imbibing some powerfully intolerable brew. put it all together though and there s little more satisfying than sipping a morning cup that you truly made yourself. like bread baking beer making and other culinary hobbies coffee roasting can be a fun way to demystify a broadly misunderstood craft says peter giuliano executive director of the coffee science foundation and chief research officer of the specialty coffee association. first get yourself some green coffee beans which are often available from specialty coffee retailers or local roasters. then collect the necessary tools one or two colanders or baking sheets and a roasting device. according to giuliano your roasting device can be simple or extravagant. one can roast coffee in a wok or a slightly modified popcorn popper but there are also specific and very good home roasting appliances designed especially for the purpose he explains. related save money by making better coffee at home . but in most home roasters opinions myself included the easiest option without investing a few hundred dollars in a purpose built device is to use the humble hot air popcorn popper which isn t unlike the professional models that wisconsin s door county coffee tea founder and co owner vicki wilson uses to roast 5000 pounds of coffee beans each week. both tumble the beans on hot high velocity air toasting them as they fly around the machine. the proper coffee roasting technique . once you have the tools all you have to do is apply heat evenly until the beans turn that beautiful coffee color giuliano says. that sounds simple but there s a lot more nuance involved. heat the beans agitating them constantly a hot air popper does this for you for three to five minutes until you hear the beans start to make an audible pop or crack. this is called the first crack and it signifies the beginning of the roasting process. you can stop roasting as soon as you hear this sound if you prefer a light roast or keep going if you want a medium or dark roast. you should also call upon your senses to assess the beans progress. a roaster may use their senses of sight smell and hearing to give them clues as to what exactly is happening in the roaster at any given moment explains giuliano. while audible cracks may be the main signifiers of how far along you are in the process aromas also chart progress acidic and flowery compounds in light roasts give way to sweet and nutty flavors in medium roasts and bittersweet chocolate notes in darker roasts according to giuliano. there s color to consider too. keep an eye on the darkening shade of the beans to gauge how far along they are in the roasting process. if you buy and consume coffee beans regularly you probably have a pretty good idea what color they should be but keep in mind that they will continue to darken as they cool so stop roasting a shade or two short. then experiment with timing to see exactly how long it takes to achieve the roast you prefer. related for better coffee start with fewer beans . a few minutes after the first crack the beans produce an audible second crack which signifies that you ve attained a dark roast. within 30 seconds after that sound or whenever you stopped at your preferred roast move the beans to a metal strainer or parchment lined tray to cool. you want to quickly cool them to stop the roasting process or the beans will continue to burn instructs wilson. you can speed up the process by transferring the beans back and forth from one strainer or tray to another which allows more cool air to lower their temperature. let the beans cool for at least 12 hours in a garage or patio or in a sink where the chaff won t create a mess all over your kitchen floor. then store them in an air tight container for freshness. what happens when you roast coffee beans . while the technique may seem straightforward there s more going on during home roasting than meets the eye. there s a chemical process taking place at the molecular level that transforms more than 800 compounds in the beans from flavorless and raw into aromatic and delicious. here s what s happening according to giuliano first as you heat the beans the tiny reserves of water they hold evaporates reducing the mass of the beans by around 11 percent. after about three to five minutes when the last bit of water escapes it turns to steam and causes the coffee beans to pop and crack. a few minutes later the second pop or crack is the result of carbon dioxide created during the roasting process. the beans will continue to release this carbon dioxide for hours even days after roasting is complete. giuliano says the heat causes a variety of chemical reactions including pyrolysis a process of temperature induced decomposition of coffee material and maillard reactions wherein sugars and proteins turn deep brown. this is similar to what s happening when foods like steak and toast brown and develop rich flavors. every type of coffee has a unique chemical reaction but giuliano says a skilled roaster knows how to coax a roast along and more importantly when to stop to get exactly the flavors they are looking for. it s a skill that only comes with practice. tips for roasting your own coffee . to get you on the right track immediately the pros have a few suggestions. first set up your workstation outdoors if possible. roasting creates a significant amount of smoke and an aroma similar to burnt popcorn so do it outside or in a well ventilated area. and keep in mind that timing is as much an issue after roasting as during. it may be tempting to grind your beans right away but that won t yield the best flavor. so wait at least 24 hours before using your beans to make a cup. related does coffee make you poop . likewise don t put the beans away as soon as they are cool. as we said they will continue to release co2 as they rest and the excess gas can cause the lid of your storage container to pop off. instead wait 12 hours before packing them up. this also helps ensure there s neither too much co2 causing poor flavor nor too little causing your beans to go stale in the final product. when your beans are ready to grind use them within a week or two for the best flavor. and if at first you don t succeed try again. experiment. that s what life s all about wilson says. once you get it fine tuned roasting your own coffee is very rewarding.

arts,"tehran following years of getting through the paperwork rey municipality is to ratify a development plan which will pave the way for extra care and maintenance of cheshmeh ali and some other historical sites across the ancient iranian city. rey municipality has formulated a plan to revive six historical sites and monuments that included cheshmeh ali tughrul tower bn babawayh cemetery and the archaeological hill and fortress of rashkan. the plan was initially drafted in the iranian calendar year 1390 mar. however it did not yield a result due to administrative procedures . iran quoted a municipality official as saying on monday. earlier this year the historical cultural and recreational site of cheshmeh ali was named a natural heritage amidst hopes to be properly safeguarded for the next generations. cheshmeh ali literally meaning spring of ali embraces an underground mineral stream that pours into an open air pool that has long been a destination for sightseers and a recreational center for the locals. during the summertime the site is occupied by hundreds of locals who came for swimming and having fun. cheshmeh ali is in the neighborhood of the ancient ebn e babveyh cemetery the 12th century tughrul tower the rashkan fortress and next to the aged rey castle. another attraction of the site is a 19th century rock carved relief that overlooks the pool. the artwork was commissioned by the qajar king fath ali shah who reigned from 1797 to 1834. cheshmeh ali also contains an archaeological site estimated to date from the 4 millennium bc. rey was one of the capital cities of the parthian empire 3rd century bc 3rd century ce and it was captured by the muslim arabs in 641 ce. during the reign of the muslim caliph al mahdi in the 8th century the city grew in importance until it was rivaled in western asia only by damascus and baghdad. according to britannica islamic writers described it as a city of extraordinary beauty built largely of fired brick and brilliantly ornamented with blue faience glazed earthenware . it continued to be an important city and was briefly a capital under the rule of the seljuqs but in the 12th century it was weakened by the fierce quarrels of rival religious sects. in 1220 the city was almost destroyed by the mongols and its inhabitants were massacred. most of the survivors of the massacre moved to nearby tehran and the deserted remnants of rey soon fell into complete ruin.

unrest,"reuters former iranian president mohammed khatami said on sunday hizbollah was a symbol of arab resistance and that groups or nations fighting oppression could not be equated with terrorists. cambridge massachusetts reuters former iranian president mohammed khatami said on sunday hizbollah was a symbol of arab resistance and that groups or nations fighting oppression could not be equated with terrorists. khatami said there was a difference between those who strive for the territorial integrity of a country and those who kill only to kill. his comments through an interpreter came in reply to a student question after he delivered a speech at harvard university s kennedy school of government. he called hizbollah which fought a 34 day war with israel in lebanon this summer and is classified as a terrorist organization by the united states a symbol of arabic resistance. washington has accused iran of arming hizbollah guerrillas. hizbollah was founded in 1982 and waged a long guerrilla war to evict israeli forces from lebanon. its recent fighting with israel was sparked after the group kidnapped two israeli soldiers in a cross border raid on july 12. khatami a cleric who was iran s president from 1997 to 2005 and was considered a reformist also denied iran financed terrorist groups contradicting assertions by the united states. replying to the same student who repeated allegations that khatami s government had financed terrorists khatami replied are you sure i gave hundreds of millions in aid to terrorists i assure you this has not happened and will not happen. it was not clear if khatami was referring just to his own government. he did not mention what policies his hard line successor mahmoud ahmadinejad might have toward hizbollah. the speech in cambridge on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the september 11 attacks on the united states marked the end of a controversial five city visit that included stops in washington and new york. mitt romney did not allow state police to escort khatami as police would normally do after calling his planned speech at harvard propaganda. about 200 protesters crowded outside the kennedy school and one child held a sign with a picture of new york s world trade center destroyed in the september 11 attacks and remember this written underneath. president george w. bush has called iran part of an axis of evil but said in an interview with the wall street journal his administration issued khatami a visa to travel in the united states because he wanted to hear his views. khatami is the highest ranking iranian to visit washington since the united states cut diplomatic ties after student radicals held 52 americans hostage during the 1979 revolution.

religion,"a macro detail of the book of psalms. rabbi marc gellman . god squad show more show less . 3of3 . dreamstime show more show less 2of3 . rabbi marc gellman . god squad show more show less . our summer vacation reading list is a study guide for the shortest psalms in the bible. i offer this eventual book as a help for my friends at the good shepherd lutheran church in harrisburg pa. we have already studied psalm 23 131 and 133. today we take up psalm 117. 1 o praise the lord all ye nations praise him all ye people. 2 for his merciful kindness is great toward us and the truth of the lord endureth for ever. the psalm simply urges us to praise god because god has abundantly blessed us. it begins with a clear and unambiguous plural imperative to all people to praise god. the reason for this universalism is that in addition to god s emancipating the israelite people from egyptian bondage god has emancipated many peoples out of many houses of bondage. amos 9 7 are ye not as children of the ethiopians unto me o children of israel saith the lord. have not i brought up israel out of the land of egypt and the philistines from caphtor and the syrians from kir this is what we call god s grace and it is intended for all peoples who sleep in the dust. the hebrew word for grace is hesed and it means god s unmerited love for us. it is a kind of love that we do not deserve because we are not so righteous that our virtue compels god to reward us. we do not deserve god s love according to judaism because we have strayed from the path of righteousness that god has set before us. according to christianity we do not deserve god s love because the sin of adam and eve in the garden of eden has stained all humanity with original sin. either way we have received so much more from god than we deserve and that spiritual excess is hesed grace. so the question now arises after we realize that we are the beneficiaries of amazing grace hesed what do we do about the reality of grace in our lives the answer of this psalm is simple and profound and spiritually perfect. the hebrew word for praising god is one of the only words that has made the journey from hebrew to english. that word is hallelujah. hallelujah is the way we say thank you to god. actually saying the words thank you to god seems a little too familiar a little too human a little too silly because we are talking to god not the deli guy who just handed us an egg salad sandwich so we say hallelujah instead. it is not that saying the words thank you to god is wrong. the medieval mystic meister eckhardt taught if the only prayer you ever say is thank you it will be enough. it s just that the words thank you are not spiritually thick enough to convey our knee bending awe at the unmerited excess of our blessings over our burdens. another reason halleluiah is the perfect word to praise is how it sounds. it is a word that mimics the human breath. we pronounce the word by breathing out hahhhh lel yahhh. this act of breathing out perfectly parallels the meaning of the word. god gives to us blessings the chief one of which is the breath of our life and we give back to god the breath of our gratitude. god breathed into adam the breath of life and we breathe into god the breath of our thankfulness. the word hallelujah is a song. the psalms and our sacred histories are filled with hundreds of repetitions of this joyous commandment to praise god. jesus sang this word song matthew 26 30 . psalm 117 is a part of a group of praising songs called the hallel psalms 113 118 that are recited at all the jewish holiday liturgies in the synagogue. when i teach children about how to pray i tell them that there are only four kinds of prayers thanks gimmie oops and wow. thanks is the first and by far the best kind of prayer. this psalm is not only about grace hesed. we sing hallelujah to give thanks for what god has done for us but we also sing hallelujah to praise god for the truth of god s words that extend into the future and the truth of the lord endureth for ever. besides the basics of life what blessings cause you to say hallelujah to god . why do we speak so much about what god has taken from us and so little about what god has given to us . what contemporary song is a praise of god . send all questions and comments to the god squad via email at real estate real estate. your guide to finding a house or apartment in connecticut .

religion,"tanya sharma after glancing over this title what is the first thought that has come to your mind are you reminded of great revolutions of the past the french or the american i know at the first instance it seems to be a bit radical. because the word revolution has to do with a fundamental change .honestly even i thought twice before putting this heading to the article .but i believe spiritual revolution is the call of the moment and we must pay heed to it. this is the first question that comes to our mind .why do we after all need this change what is wrong with the way things are going for answering this question i would first like you to peep into the glorious history of india. india has been a land of great spiritual masters. ours is the land of wisdom and knowledge acquired through the path of spiritual quest. but over a period of time we have seen degradation in that proud tradition. our colonial past and westernization can be one factor responsible for that. because we were told by the colonial masters that whatever is western is superior to the ancient indian traditional .rather what we are witnessing today is a sense of alienation from that tradition. the first challenge that people often experience when they try to follow this path is a sense of unacceptance. unacceptance from themselves and from the near and dear ones. this is because of a wrong understanding of the word spiritual .generally people associate ascetism tapasya meditation leaving the worldly life etc. with this path. but in my understanding this is a wrong conception of this word. although the perceptions are changing. today people really boast about the fact that they meditate. but there is a lack of true understanding .and one thing that is responsible for this is the erosion of the super productive guru shishya parampara that was prevalent in india. anyway that is a topic big enough to be discussed separately .the point that i try to make here is that we have forgotten our rich spiritual treasure and thereby living a life of unhappiness and unfulfillment. therefore there is a strong need to revisit our past wisdom understand it and bring a change by applying it into our lives. the word to carry forward the discussion i would like to throw some light on the word spiritual as per my understanding .to me spirituality means understanding your spirit or soul or simply yourself and taking it to a higher level of consciousness trying to connect it with the ultimate power soul energy universe whatever you believe in . so for me self discovery and self transformation is the basic mantra of spirituality .and it is an irony that today human beings are keen enough to discover life on mars but not much keen to discover their own self although now people are recognizing its importance and things are definitely changing . but what we need is a thorough change. so the next question that follows is that how are we going to bring about this revolution the self revolution the good thing about this is that it is a self revolution a thorough fundamental change in your own self .a way to conquer your own self. at later stages you will observe that you will automatically start affecting influencing the lives of others as well .today the lives have become so complex that people are not able to get answers to their own questions . the social bonds have also weakened to a great extent. people are living a life full of pretensions .the social media is an epitome of that where you try to portray everything rosy happening in your life but hollow inside .in such a scenario to understand the true essence of lifeget answers to your questions and to lead a really meaningful life the spiritual journey is very vital. at this initial stage it is not very easy to chalk out how this revolution can come about. however i can think of the following steps that we can take at the personal level. the first step i would like you to take is to simply spare thirty minutes every day for yourself away from all distractions .just sit down with yourself and try to connect with your own being. some people may call it meditation. but that will be little big a target to begin with. initially we have to cultivate a habit to be in our own company in silence. believe me people find it difficult to sit with themselves even for two minutes .either they start negative thinking or they need something to distract them mobile phone for instance .but gradually one can form a habit . the other step that i would recommend is that try accumulating the pearls of wisdom by reading some good texts. our holy books are a great read for a spiritual experience be it the bhagwad gita the bible the quran the guru granth sahib or the buddhist texts etc. reading the original version is quite difficult. but there are good translations and interpretations available these days. although even i have not been able to move beyond gita till now but it is definitely in my bucket list to enrich my personality .these books were written to teach us a way of life. today we have dissociated with this knowledge and therefore experiencing things like existential crisis . apart from that we especially the youth should read the works of great personalities like swami vivekananda gandhiji etc. reading such texts with a critical and analytical mind will definitely help us find answers to our questions. i personally like to use the word spiritual rather than religious because religions have actually divided humanity instead of unifying it. the spirit is same in every human being. so we can better relate and interact with the other being as a soul spirit divine manifestation. the present state of human existence and society is not very encouraging. on the material front we are progressing at a very rapid pace. but at the same time we are experiencing an erosion of values humanity moralitythe rise in crime rates violence and corruption .on the other hand the gap between rich and poor is widening day by day . the natural environment is degrading corona was an alarm bell for all .on the personal level people are stressedanxious unhappy and in a rush to achieve more and more .the community ties and social bonds are not so strong. i do not intend to bring pessimism in the mind of my i do believe that if each one of us at a personal level imbibe the spiritual ethical and moral principles in our lives we are definitely going to take our living to a next level and lead a meaningful and happy life. i would like to conclude by saying that the world has already witnessed the scientific and industrial revolution led primarily by the west. now it s the time for the magic of the spiritual revolution and let india be the pioneer of that. spirituality is the greatest and healthiest exercise that human mind can have swami vivekananda the author is a a probationary officer at state bank of india .

labour,"retirement is n t the sort of thing you should just dive into. in fact you should really spend most of your working life planning for that milestone and that includes saving steadily investing wisely and as you get older narrowing down the right age to bring your career to a close. but even if you make a solid effort to plan for retirement you may run into some snags. here are a few all too common mistakes people make on the road to retirement and how to avoid falling victim to them. 1. relying too heavily on social security . many people assume that once they retire social security will allow them to cover most or all of their bills. in reality the average senior today collects 1543 a month. if you re an average earner and your social security benefits end up constituting the bulk of your retirement income you could be headed for trouble. furthermore just because the typical senior on social security gets 1543 a month does n t mean that s what your benefit will look like. you may be entitled to a lot more money than that or much less. that s why it s a good idea to get an estimate of your monthly benefit ahead of time and you can do so by accessing your social security earnings statement which is issued to you once a year. the closer you get to retirement the more accurate that estimate will be but even if you re in your 30s or 40s you can use it as a starting point. if you re at least 60 your earnings statement should arrive in the mail each year. otherwise you can create an account on the social security administration s website and look at it there. keep in mind that your social security filing age will also determine what your monthly benefit amounts to. but having an estimate in advance can help you better plan for the future. 2. setting a random savings target . many people in the course of their planning set a retirement savings goal that s arbitrary. for example you ll often hear that 1 million will guarantee you financial security for the rest of your life. but rather than fixate on a specific number like 1 million you should aim for a savings total that s a multiple of your income. a good rule of thumb is to retire with 10 to 12 times your ending salary saved. if you earn 100000 a year then yes you may want to aim to retire with 1 million. but if you earn 50000 a year you could end up living a very comfortable lifestyle as a senior if you manage to close out your career with 500000 to 600000 in your ira or 401 k plan. 3. forgetting about taxes . in fact you should really spend most of your working life planning for that

depending on your total income. and then there are pension payments if you re fortunate enough to have some to look forward to you should expect to pay taxes on them as well. to avoid a financial crunch later in life read up on taxes in retirement and work with an accountant or financial advisor to see what strategies you can employ to keep your irs burden to a minimum. you may want to move some of your savings from a traditional retirement plan to a roth account for example to get yourself into a lower tax bracket as a senior. while planning ahead for retirement is a smart move falling

west virginia on thursday to promote the role that the once booming coal producing state will play in the development of clean energy. joe manchin and granholm were joined at a news conference in morgantown with partners in a collaboration to build a ship in part using steel manufactured in landlocked west virginia to transport parts for offshore wind development projects. this is sort of a window into the opportunity for west virginia to be a leader in the energy of the future in addition to having led the energy that got us here and that still powers us granholm said. offshore wind development is still in its infancy in the far behind progress made in europe. a small wind farm operates near block island in waters controlled by the state of rhode island and another small wind farm operates off the coast of virginia. the so called jones act prohibits foreign flagged ships from hauling cargo between ports. therefore dominion energy will own the 470 foot 143 meter ship named

infrastructure plan. first lady jill biden joined manchin at a coronavirus vaccination clinic last month a few days after manchin met at the white house with the president on the infrastructure plan. the nation s second largest coal producer west virginia has lost 56 of its mining jobs since 2009 as power plants turn toward renewable energy sources. because in part of those jobs lost west virginia lost the highest percentage of its population of any state in the past decade. we have a golden opportunity now with the new infrastructure bill coming that energy is going to play such an important part and how we can lead in the world in a clean energy transformation manchin said. it s really what it s all about. you cannot eliminate your way to a cleaner climate. both senators have frustrated democrats with their defense of the filibuster the rule requiring most legislation to win 60 votes to pass making many of democrats biggest priorities like voting rights and gun control bills dead on arrival in the 50 50 senate. during her two day visit to west virginia granholm a former michigan governor also is scheduled to tour an underground coal mine and a rare earth elements lab. the stop

education,"corequisite model enrolls students immediately in credit bearing college level gateway courses . it s widely understood that the pandemic has intensified racial disparities across many dimensions of our society including employment health and education. public universities and community colleges which serve a large share of racially minoritized and low income students saw significant enrollment declines last fall. this does not bode well for racial and socioeconomic disparities in education attainment. as higher education institutions look to strengthen their equity efforts remedial education reform is crucial. early barriers prevent students from building momentum that can propel them to graduation. it is imperative to design pathways that ensure all students whether they re young people arriving out of high school or adults balancing work and family get early and sustaining academic wins. more from ub were b students really enrolled at higher rates than a students . this is the aim of the corequisite support model which more than a dozen states have implemented at scale in recent years with support from complete college america. leaders in these states rejected the traditional remedial model which focuses on the perceived shortcomings of incoming college students deciding to instead address institutional shortcomings. how quickly the needle can move . implementing corequisite support is a win win for students and institutions. all states must swiftly enact this strategy to improve the lives of black latinx and low income students who are disproportionately placed into traditional remediation. the corequisite support model is different. students are immediately enrolled in credit bearing college level gateway courses while also taking a corequisite support course the same semester. they begin earning credits toward a degree while receiving appropriate supports to ensure their success. data proving the corequisite model s undeniable value especially among low income and racially minoritized students has become overwhelming. students are more likely to complete gateway courses and graduate when they do not have to spend time and money on long sequences of noncredit bearing remedial courses. the university system of georgia shows how quickly the needle can move. since abandoning traditional remedial approaches in favor of corequisites in 2015 its campuses have seen the percentage of students who complete college level gateway courses double. math course completion rates of african american and latinx students rose more than 45 percentage points reaching 65 and 71 respectively. the system has effectively closed its institutional performance gaps through corequisite support and related strategies. creating student ready colleges . over the years as complete college america has worked with institutions to scale reforms many have raised concerns about the costs of developing new corequisite courses. we believe such concerns while important need to be re examined. emerging evidence suggests the benefits of change outweigh the cost with more students persisting through degree programs tuition revenues rise. for example after west virginia community colleges moved to the corequisite model they saw an increase in tuition revenue of 54000 and that was just the first year before wide scale adoption. of course transforming remediation is fundamentally about supporting student success not money. what is needed is a philosophical shift in mindset from producing college ready students to creating student ready colleges. traditional remediation is deficit oriented. in contrast the corequisite model is opportunity oriented it looks to build on existing skills by providing critical supports that drive success. during the last decade we have seen the corequisite support model adopted by colleges and universities across the country. this national reform movement should be celebrated but its pace must accelerate to reflect the urgency of the problem. the good news is that implementing change at scale can happen swiftly when leaders are committed. we encourage institutions systems and states to use the new complete college america report as a playbook for change it offers best practices for shifting policy and implementing proven strategies. there is no need to reinvent the wheel. reform is not a one time proposition of course it is an iterative process of continuous improvement. and corequisite supports are just one dimension of the broader systems change required to spark greater equity and student success. more from ub state by state look at colleges requiring covid 19 vaccines . in the coming months and years our organizations will continue to work with leaders in both government and higher education to reshape the forces that determine college outcomes and spur institutional transformation. we will advance a student centered agenda built around new policies practices and research that changes the narrative from failed student achievement to the real issue of institutional performance gaps. the traditional remedial model is a clear example of a failed structure that perpetuates racial and economic disparities. with a historic crisis highlighting our society s inequalities we must move beyond talking about problems to implement proven scalable solutions. it s past time for all schools to prove their commitment to greater equity by embracing sustainable systems change. what s at stake is nothing less than improving the life chances of millions of college students. there s no excuse for continued inaction. yolanda watson spiva is president of complete college america. maxine roberts is the director of strong start to finish.

science,"teacher maggie boyd feurtado co founded the accelerated math program that lab middle school for collaborative studies is doing away with. stefan jeremiah for new york post . lab middle school for collaborative studies a top chelsea middle school angered parents this week when its principal announced it was scrapping accelerated math classes. the program co founded by teacher maggie boyd feurtado gave students who showed aptitude in math the opportunity to learn higher concepts. now the school encouraged by a department of education that is hostile to gifted and talented programs or any sort of academic screens said that every student would have the same lessons. here teacher feurtado explains why this misguided quest for equity is hurting all kids. i am old enough to remember the 1972 version of the thriller the poseidon adventure. the ss poseidon traveling from new york to greece on its final cruise is hit by a tsunami and capsizes. a large contingent of people remains in the ballroom waiting for help. a small group led by gene hackman decides to climb to the top of the ship which is really the bottom because the ship is upside down. along the way gene hackman s group encounters another group that is making its way to the top of the ship which is underwater. hackman says you re going the wrong way dammit. they do not listen and do not survive. gene hackman announced you re going the wrong way in the film the poseidon adventure and the same could be said for the direction we re taking education. 20thcentfox courtesy everett collection . we are going the wrong way on education. we hear phrases such as algebra for all or equity but have different interpretations of their meanings. algebra for all doesn t mean that everyone should take an algebra course in 8th grade or any other specific grade. it means that everyone should be exposed to an algebra course when they are academically ready. today algebraic thinking is fostered in math classes long before students take an algebra course. this is done through problem solving using patterns leading to generalizations. some students grasp this quickly while others require more time. there is nothing wrong with taking more time. yes algebra for all is expected at the appropriate time. one size fits all math is not the answer. ability grouped math classes mean that no one should be bored feel that there is no challenge or be frustrated by the level of difficulty of the work. we want students to be persistent and relish rich challenging opportunities at their levels. they can study topics that are not normally included in the curriculum and can avoid unnecessary repetition. they have opportunities to be involved in contests such as mathcounts math league or amc8. they learn to appreciate and love the elegance of mathematics the way someone appreciates literature or music. the intangible benefits of the accelerated math classes can have life changing results as i ve seen from my former students. fiona is at mit zach is at oxford jeffrey is at cornell nancy is at carnegie mellon eugene is at yale winston is at uc berkley just to name a few. so many students attend stuyvesant bronx science and brooklyn tech. all of them have benefitted from early exposure to advanced material. josh said it best i have now gone far beyond box plots and histograms and the cartesian coordinate plane yet though the content is different the force that pushes me forward is the same one i felt in your room in seventh grade. with your help i have learned things far beyond what i thought i could i have gone further than i thought possible. he is now an undergraduate researcher at rise lab uc berkley. parents of students attending the nyc lab school for collaborative studies were angry after the announcement of a watered down math curriculum. in 2013 a study by courtney collins and li gan showed that both high and low performing students scores in math rose when they were grouped based on previous performance not all forced to learn the same things at the same rate. yes to algebra for all yes to equal opportunity. let s challenge all of our students at the appropriate level. and applaud everyone s progress. one size fits all math is not the answer.

unrest,"cairo march 19 xinhua the arab league arab parliament and egypt condemned on friday a drone attack by yemen s houthi militia on an aramco oil facility in saudi arabia s capital riyadh. in a statement the arab league said the attack clearly reflects the agenda of the houthi group and its supporters which does not target saudi arabia alone but rather seeks to threaten the energy supplies a fundamental pillar of the stability of the global economy. the pan arab organization headquartered in cairo urged the international community to exert greater pressure on the houthi group and those behind it to stop these attacks that seek to inflame the situation and block any serious attempt for a peaceful solution. meanwhile the cairo based arab parliament described the attack as a dangerous reprehensible escalation and extension of the terrorist acts of the houthi militia. egypt also condemned the houthi attacks saying they represent a direct threat to the security and stability of saudi arabia and its people as well as global oil supplies. the north african country expressed support for saudi arabia s measures to maintain its security and stability in order to confront all forms of terrorism the egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement. earlier in the day yemen s houthi militia said they launched multiple attacks at saudi aramco facilities in riyadh using six explosive laden drones. the attacks hit the targets accurately the houthi run al masirah tv quoted a statement by the militia s military spokesman yehya sarea as saying. the houthis have stepped up cross border attacks against saudi cities and oil facilities recently but most of the attacks were foiled by the saudi led coalition forces. yemen has been mired in a civil war since late 2014 when the iran backed houthis seized control of several northern yemeni provinces and forced the internationally recognized government of president abd rabbu mansour hadi out of the capital sanaa. the saudi led arab coalition intervened in the yemeni conflict in 2015 to support hadi s government.

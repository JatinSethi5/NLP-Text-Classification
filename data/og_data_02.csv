environmental,"a coalition of unions utility officials and democratic and republican lawmakers from central and southern illinois called on gov. jb pritzker and legislative leaders friday to exempt nonprofit coal fired plants from mandated 2035 closures in an upcoming clean energy bill. springfield already is doing the right things to transition to a zero carbon future springfield mayor jim langfelder said at a news conference at the steamfitters plumbers local 137 hall in springfield. doug brown chief utility officer of springfield s municipality owned city water light power said it is not feasible for the utility to close all of its coal fired units in 14 years without the potential for higher electricity bills for consumers and shortages of power downstate that could lead to brown outs and electricity restrictions. aaron gurnsey president of the central illinois building construction trades council said the potential plant closure schedule being discussed in the state capitol would n t provide enough time to accommodate downstate communities and preserve the more than 1100 workers jobs at cwlp and at prairie state energy in st. clair county and an additional 1000 skilled union jobs. energy policy is complex gurnsey said. all we re asking for is more time to make the transition to new energy sources in a responsible manner that protects workers and taxpayers. the general assembly adjourned this week without voting on a clean energy bill. preliminary versions of the legislation would provide state subsidies to chicago based exelon to avoid the closure of the unprofitable byron and dresden nuclear power plants and potentially other nuclear sites in northern illinois. democrats who control the illinois house and senate as well as pritzker a democrat said negotiations are almost complete. members of the legislature are expected to return to springfield in the coming weeks to finalize the deal and forward it to pritzker s desk. tim butler r springfield said he does n t think the state officials involved in negotiating the clean energy bill realize what s at stake for coal fired plants and communities in central and southern illinois. decisions are being made for our communities with little understanding about how it will impact the lives of our residents butler said. jobs reliability and affordability of electricity must be top of mind. in the short term renewable energy such as wind power cannot replace the number of jobs associated with coal fired plants he said. we do n t question the increased role renewables will play in our state s energy future but we have to create responsible transitional policy that includes diversity of baseload resources to ensure our electric grid remains strong as further technologies are developed he said. doris turner d springfield said we are not asking for subsidies for these plants. all we are requesting is they be recognized for the value they bring to our economy and our state s reliable electric grid by giving our communities a longer runway. langfelder said cwlp began its commitment to scrubber technology allowing cleaner burning of high sulphur illinois coal in 1980. that commitment preserved local jobs at cwlp generating units and in local coal mines he said. one of cwlp s units dallman 4 was completed in 2009 and built to meet the then obama administration s environmental standards langfelder said. dallman 4 was one of the cleanest coal fired units in the country at the time of its completion the mayor said. borrowing to pay for dallman 4 wo n t be paid off until 2040 and the unit helps to provide a base level of electricity to supplement renewable forms of energy that cwlp depends on. brown said cwlp needs to provide energy to support a reliable and resilient electrical grid until the technology for cleaner resources such as batteries or carbon capture or burning can catch up in springfield. we do n t need energy legislation that forces an early shutdown of dallman 4 while we still have bond payments he said. cwlp right now ca n t afford to buy all of its power from outside sources brown said. a replacement resource must be built in the dallman footprint or we would be required to build major transmission and infrastructure upgrades to ensure that we can deliver all the power the city needs he said. pritzker told the state journal register thursday that provisions to retain as many coal related workers as possible and provide services to help others transition to different jobs is being worked on for the final clean energy bill. the governor would n t divulge more details but said it s very important that we phase out coal so that we move to a clean energy environment. this bill will do a great deal and really make illinois a leader in the midwest in the fight against climate change. we certainly want to make sure that we protect ratepayers across the board in this energy bill. shortly before the friday morning

time to get down to the nitty gritty of making sure the state meets the lofty goals of the law like creating a net zero greenhouse gas emission limit by 2050. the law triggers an initial series of changes throughout 2021 and 2022 according to democratic sen. mike barrett co chair of the committee on telecommunication utilities and energy. some of those initial steps may seem modest even bureaucratic but supporters say they re critical to helping the state transition to a renewable energy future. one step calls for the state department of public utilities to consider six factors as it decides electric power and natural gas rates reviews electric and gas company contracts and makes policy. while reliability and affordability remain crucial the law adds four new criteria safety security from cyberattacks and physical sabotage equity and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. the law also requires the state energy efficiency initiative mass save to factor in a new goal the social value of greenhouse gas emission reductions into programs it creates for the three year period 2022 2024. the new goal means offering incentives for consumers to adopt technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions like replacing an oil burning furnace for an electric heat pump barrett said. it s essentially the reverse of a carbon tax a carrot instead of a stick. carbon pricing penalizes energy sources that pollute. social values pricing rewards energy sources that are clean barrett said. that should have been a no brainer. the administration is working to put the law into effect. the 2022 2024 plan is already under development. the plan would limit fossil fuel space heating incentives only to technologies where clear cost effective savings remain and phase out fossil fuel water heating incentives according to administration spokesperson katie gronendyke. the administration has also updated the state s environmental justice policy as required by the law with a new definition of environmental justice population typically lower income communities facing greater health risks from pollution and the process by which neighborhoods may be included under that policy. the dpu s mission statement has also been updated to reflect the goals of the law. the mission of the dpu is to ensure that consumers rights are protected and that utility companies are providing the most reliable service at the lowest possible cost the updated statement reads in part. the dpu seeks to promote safety security reliability of service affordability equity and greenhouse gas emission reductions. under the law the governor must also appoint three new members of the board of building regulations and standards. one must be an expert in commercial building energy efficiency another an expert in residential building energy efficiency and the third an expert in advanced building technology. the new law includes additional steps like incremental goals every five years to reach a 50 reduction in emissions by 2030 before meeting the 2050 goal. the law would also require an additional 2400 megawatts of offshore wind set appliance energy efficiency standards create benchmarks for the adoption of clean energy technologies like electric vehicles charging stations solar technology and energy storage and create an energy code to allow net zero building construction for towns that want it. while the new law takes a series of important steps the state shouldn t stop there according to ben hellerstein state director of environment massachusetts. advocates are pushing an even more ambitious goal of transitioning massachusetts to 100 clean electricity by 2035 and 100 clean heating and transportation by 2045 noting that other states are already setting similarly ambitious benchmarks. former democratic rhode island gov. gina raimondo had signed an executive order making 2030 the target date for the state to completely transition to renewable energy sources. state lawmakers are weighing a bill that would write that goal into law. it s time for massachusetts to take a step further by pledging to phase out the use of fossil fuels for heating and transportation too hellerstein said. the key to the massachusetts law is constant vigilance to make sure the smaller intermediate steps are met barrett said.

environmental,"tokyo reuters the japan bank for international cooperation jbic will provide support for exports from coal power plants if they come with emissions cutting steps such as carbon capture and storage ccs and co firing ammonia jbic governor tadashi maeda said on tuesday. file photo a man walks past a sign of japan bank for international cooperation jbic at it s headquarters in tokyo japan june 6 2016. the group of seven nations pledged earlier this month to rapidly scale up technologies and policies that accelerate the transition away from unabated coal capacity including ending new government support for coal power by the end of this year. unabated coal power means lacking measures to cut emissions. the bank plans to support the use of ammonia or hydrogen as a co firing fuel in thermal power generation with the understanding that they are needed to slash carbon dioxide emissions in a transition period he said. ammonia is used for fertiliser and industrial materials but is also seen as a potential effective future energy source along with hydrogen. it does not emit carbon dioxide when burned. the state owned bank announced a new three year business plan through march 2024 under which it will provide finance to help expand renewable energy and create a hydrogen supply chain as well as transition finance to support ccus ammonia co firing projects among others. jbic will continue financing upstream development of liquefied natural gas lng and gas fired power generation projects as part of transition finance maeda said. as for gas we have to take into account various derivative elements such as energy security and trade balance issues he said adding it was not realistic to suddenly rely solely on renewable energy. japanese government is looking to tighten its rules on support for exports of new coal power plants in line with the g7 pact. reporting by yuka obayashi editing by david evans .

environmental,"deirdre michie obe oil gas uk chief executive . the recent legal challenge brought against the uk government over its continued support for oil and gas production in the north sea has sparked new conversations around the industry s impact on the government s stated goal of net zero emissions by 2050. a common thread through these conversations is that oil and gas still provides three quarters of the uk s energy needs with domestic production meeting 70 per cent of demand in 2020 alone. considering this it makes no sense to stop producing oil and gas at home and start importing it from projects abroad where we have no control over emissions. that said we recognise that the balance is changing and the industry is fully committed to the energy transition working hard to make our operations greener and investing in new alternatives that will shape our energy future. the development of such technologies will be accelerated due to the recently announced north sea transition deal which will help us to reduce carbon emissions even more quickly. this is just one reason why we believe the uk can set a world leading example of how the transition can be delivered all the while protecting jobs across the country. scotland is a key player here and work is already under way to advance expertise in low cost carbon capture and storage. this involves repurposing legacy oil and gas fields to capture and store carbon offering vast potential for clean energy production. the acorn project in st fergus peterhead is capturing carbon dioxide from an existing gas plant and using it to produce hydrogen while the existing offshore pipeline infrastructure transports it to offshore carbon storage. there is also scottishpower s new green hydrogen scheme near glasgow which aims to produce up to eight tonnes of hydrogen for the commercial market by 2023. scotland s renewable energy goals are another part of this picture. in 2020 scotland was able to generate of its household electricity demand from renewable sources and by 2030 the country is aiming for renewable energy to meet 50 of all demand across electricity heat and transport. while oil and gas will continue to be part of the mix as alternative energies achieve full scale the industry is till supporting the development of renewables with investment and skills. hywind scotland developed and owned by equinor is the world s first floating wind farm that takes wind turbine technology one step further by removing the need for a fixed base thus ending restrictions on water depth. each of these examples show how oil and gas producing nations like scotland can be part of the energy transition set an example on a global stage protect jobs and support communities. so while we re still using oil and gas for everyday essentials let s be accountable let s make it home grown and let s show the world what s possible. deirdre michie obe is oil gas uk chief executive .

quebec health minister christian dub said on thursday that there will be about 150000 patients facing delays by october. dub said the first step will be to stabilize the list by the end of the year but the number wo n t start to fall until 2022. perhaps the timeline may seem sometimes in some cases distant. but i think it s still our job our role to be realistic the health minister said. the goal is to be performing some 40000 surgeries per month by march 2023. currently that number hovers around 26000 and was up to 34000 before the pandemic. before covid 19 hit quebec about 4000 patients

health,"former centers for disease control cdc director robert redfield explained why he thinks the ccp virus came from a chinese lab the wuhan institute of virology or wiv echoing support for the theory that was first dismissed as having no scientific merit and not worth investigating. the former cdc director sat down with dr. marc siegel a professor at nyu and fox news contributor to discuss the pandemic s origins. the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid and the government s voice of scientific authority on the pandemic before and during the pandemic dr. anthony fauci has long argued that the virus came from an animal market in wuhan china and not a lab leak. until last month the infectious disease expert had maintained that covid 19 had developed naturally. fauci told national geographic in may 2020 that there s no scientific evidence that the ccp virus was made in a lab. everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that this virus evolved in nature and then jumped species fauci told the publication at the time. the statement from last year was completely false adm. brett giroir former department of health and human services hhs assistant secretary told fox news. there was no pattern of mutations that suggest that it went right from an animal in a natural situation to humans and there s still no evidence to show that. redfield argued that the covid 19 virus has a much faster rate of transmission than other lethal coronaviruses such as sars and mers which have been found to spread through animals and at a much slower rate. there s an alternative hypothesis that it went from a bat virus got into a laboratory where in the laboratory it was taught educated it evolved so that it became a virus that could efficiently transmit human to human redfield said. and my professional opinion as a virologist is that s the hypothesis that i support. you know other individuals tony fauci for example would say that he prefers to support it evolved from nature. early reports about an outbreak of the ccp virus first appeared in wuhan in late 2019 when a cluster of cases was reported by state controlled media to be linked to a local wet market. more than a year later the origins of the virus remain unconfirmed although the theory that the virus leaked from a laboratory at china s wuhan institute of virology is gaining traction. peter daszak a member of the world health organization team investigating the origins of covid 19 speaks to media upon arriving at the wuhan institute of virology in wuhan in china s central hubei province on feb. the lab leak theory which until recently had been dismissed by most mainstream media outlets gained significant traction after the wall street journal reported on may 23 that three researchers at the wiv were hospitalized in november 2019 with symptoms consistent with seasonal flu and covid 19. the newspaper cited unnamed government sources familiar with a previously undisclosed intelligence report. redfield a virologist expressed disappointment in what he described as a lack of openness within scientific circles to pursue both hypotheses. i m just giving my best opinion as a virologist and i don t think it s plausible that this virus went from a bat to an animal we still don t know that animal and then went into humans and immediately had learned how to be human to human transmissible to the point of now causing one of the greatest pandemics we ve had in the history of the world redfield said. president joe biden in may ordered the intelligence community to ramp up efforts to investigate the virus s origins and produce a report in 90 days. chinese scientists and officials have consistently rejected the lab leak hypothesis claiming the virus could have circulated in other regions before it hit wuhan and might have even entered china through imported frozen food shipments or wildlife trading. the world health organization who published a report about its investigation to identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population including the possible role of intermediate hosts including through efforts such as scientific and collaborative field missions. who director general dr. tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said the findings of the probe were inconclusive and called for further investigations. redfield expressed concern that the who was highly compromised by the ccp. clearly they were incapable of compelling china to adhere to the treaty agreements that they have on global health because they didn t do that. clearly they allowed china to define the group of scientists that could come and investigate redfield said. that s not consistent with their role.

health,"when wildfire smoke blanketed vancouver in september 2020 the effects were soon felt in the city s emergency rooms. we do see it at the peak of the wildfire season said dr. don sin a respirologist at st. paul s hospital in vancouver. most people who are vulnerable to smoke s effects are extra careful he said but those with conditions like asthma and other lung related issues as well as people with cardiac diseases and pregnant women are most at risk of harm. wildfire smoke is known to be dangerous but as the number and intensity of wildfires grow scientists are closely examining the smoke looking at what s in it and how it might harm human health in both the short and long term. what exactly is in wildfire smoke depends a lot on what s burning according to lisa miller a professor at the uc davis school of veterinary medicine who has researched the effects of wildfire smoke. it s not that we don t know what should be in the smoke. it s that it changes so much depending upon what s being burned she said. different kinds of trees can send up different kinds of particles for example. and when a wildfire burns houses and everything in the houses and buildings the smoke changes again she said. when you re burning things like plastics electronics the chemistry of the smoke changes dramatically and can become much much more toxic. wildfire smoke isn t just floating across canada it s reaching ireland . essentially wildfire smoke contains particles volatile gases and even organisms like bacteria and fungi explained sarah henderson scientific director of environmental health services at the bc centre for disease control. the particles especially fine particulate matter known as can be inhaled deep into the lungs where it can cause irritation and inflammation according to the bccdc. the gases in the smoke can irritate the eyes nose and throat and even the airways of people who have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. and then there are the living creatures found in smoke. some recent studies published in the isme journal and the journal fire identified living bacteria and fungi in wildfire smoke. the researchers held up petri dishes or flew drones over fires to collect the smoke and compared what they found with samples taken from non smoky air said leda kobziar an associate professor of wildland fire science at the university of idaho and one of the authors on these studies. her team found more than 100 fungal species and over 900 different bacteria in the smoke. we re finding all sorts of things a lot of organisms that are known to live in soils some that are known to live inside plants others that live on plants and others that are common to the air and then some that are not common to background air conditions she said. so a really wide diversity organisms that have a variety of different types of ecological roles and have a variety of different types of potential effects on crops or on human health. kobziar said that scientists aren t sure yet whether these bacteria and fungi found in smoke will end up being harmful to human health. it s clear though that smoke exposure has significant health effects. a recent review found that wildfires were linked to increased er visits for respiratory problems asthma and copd related visits more hospital admissions for cardiovascular events and even higher mortality. being exposed to wildfire smoke also means you re more likely to get sick from pathogens that you encounter according to sin. when some someone inhales wildfire the pathogens tend to stick in the lungs better. and so they re at increased risk of respiratory symptoms pneumonia and various complications related to these pathogens he said. researchers are also getting a clearer idea of what kinds of health effects wildfire smoke might cause long term. scientists at the california national primate research centre including miller got a unique opportunity to study this in their monkeys over the last few years. in 2008 miller said a particularly large wildfire blanketed the area in smoke. a number of infant rhesus macaque monkeys which were housed outdoors spent around two weeks breathing in the smoke. after the fires the scientists studied the monkeys closely taking blood samples ct scans and performing lung function tests. three years after they were exposed to the smoke the monkeys still showed reduced lung function. some of the monkeys developed interstitial lung disease or even fibrosis miller said. what this means is instead of the lungs being reactive or the airways being reactive the lungs actually get stiff. so it makes it difficult for an individual to breathe on a regular basis. wildfire smoke has exposed millions to hazardous air pollution analysis shows . monkeys who were pregnant during the wildfire were actually slightly more likely to miscarry according to dr. kent pinkerton another researcher at the primate research centre and a professor of pediatrics at uc davis. monkeys aren t humans of course and these monkeys were actually probably more likely to show effects from smoke than humans would be because they lived outside in the smoky air when most people would spend most of their time indoors miller said. more research is needed to see whether people who were exposed to smoke had these same issues she added. all of the research suggests that we will see increasingly severe and prolonged wildfire seasons and that means increasingly severe long smoke exposures said henderson. so she said people and public health authorities need to be prepared. go into every wildfire season expecting it s the worst you ve ever seen. expert recommends staying indoors as west coast wildfire smoke reaches saskatchewan . she said there are three main ways to protect people on smoky days keeping indoor air clean minimizing your time outside and not exerting yourself when outdoors and using a mask. individuals with pre existing cardiopulmonary conditions when there s wildfire should stay home said sin. do not do strenuous exercises do not bike do not do any of those things. stay indoors until the air clears up. then you know then they will be in much better shape.

health,"apollo beach fla. the florida aquarium reached another major milestone in its mission to restore the coral reefs thanks to crossbreeding and cryopreservation. scientists bred grooved brain corals collected near fort lauderdale and matured in the lab with wild samples from more southern waters. a smattering of golden brown coral babies living on small ceramic tiles at the aquarium s apollo beach campus. little miracles said emily williams a biologist on the coral conservation team. the successful reproduction effort created offspring with greater genetic diversity and disease resistance than those populating the florida atlantic coast scientists say. that means they may be better equipped to withstand the threats ravaging the world s third largest reef including climate change and ocean acidification. stony tissue coral disease also entered florida reefs in 2014 obliterating vast stretches of 20 coral species. the more genetic diversity the corals have the better chance they eventually have to battle threats and changes senior biologist rachel serafin said. the crossbred coral babies grow in a golden brown color on rectangular ceramic tiles. in an ideal future devastated ecosystems could be rebuilt with these stronger lab spawned samples. red and orange corals that first felt water in a tank could repopulate the waters off martin county south to the florida keys. our end goal is to put ourselves out of a job williams said. to restore the corals to their former glory where they are happy and healthy and thriving without us. researchers at the florida aquarium have been working toward that goal for years. they coaxed imperiled atlantic ocean coral into spawning in a laboratory in late 2019. ridged cactus coral followed closely behind in april 2020. but this may marked the first time florida preservationists used frozen preserved sperm to breed samples collected miles apart at different times. the florida aquarium scavenged the fort lauderdale coast for healthy grooved brain corals to save from stony tissue coral disease in spring 2018 and 2019. as part of the florida coral rescue project researchers rushed the animals out of vulnerable waters and the rescued colonies spawned under human care. williams stored milliliters of resulting sperm in liquid nitrogen and a substance that freezes the tissues indefinitely. on the other side of the sunshine state last month um scientists initiated a similar process collecting and cryopreserving sperm from wild brain corals off key largo. with two white metal containers of sperm in her car s backseat williams left for naples. like a soccer mom driving the kids serafin said. a um researcher in south florida drove toward her. the defrosted sperm mingled with eggs slowly but surely at both facilities that evening. researchers crafted ideal conditions for the samples by manipulating light and water levels. watching the coral reproduction process was like seeing a living snow globe with little bundles floating to the surface williams said. as those bundles break down the water became cloudy and hazy with the sperm. two days later coral larvae from the mixtures began metamorphosing into baby corals in the florida aquarium lab. the same thing was happening in miami. both institutions had reared crossbred offspring. the two brain coral specimens used in the effort are otherwise unlikely to find one another because of the distance between their oceanic homes. only in the lab can the animals be brought together to reproduce. that s a hopeful sign that even though there are all these horrible dangers for the corals there are things that science can do baker said. just one pair of brain corals can produce thousands of offspring each year. when bred in a controlled laboratory survival can be as high as 50 compared with less than 1 in the wild. now researchers turn to the lives ahead of the new crossbred baby corals. the florida aquarium placed the babies on non toxic tiles in shallow tanks with circulating saltwater. the animals will be shadowed and sheltered to maturity or until preservationists determine an alternate next step. they hope the animals can one day be released into the atlantic to thrive and reproduce independently. reefs could be saved by these reproduction efforts by strengthening the species. the recent findings in florida have been shared with coral preservationists worldwide who are eager to mend comparably vulnerable coral ecosystems in australia south america and beyond. losing corals is not an option for the oceans serafin said. coral restoration is increasingly relying on sexual reproduction and selective breeding added baker. we can t just wait for nature to correct the balance and repopulate the reefs.

labour," a senate panel whose members previously asked the attorney general to probe for criminal conduct at the state agency that houses and educates south carolina s juvenile offenders has issued a vote of no confidence in that agency s embattled director. all five members of a senate corrections and penology subcommittee that has spent the past two months holding hearings on an audit that identified issues with the staffing training and finances at the department of juvenile justice voiced their displeasure with director freddie pough s leadership wednesday after a four hour hearing where current and former employees testified about their experiences working at the agency. the proof s in the pudding said sen. dick harpootlian d richland who has repeatedly asked pough to resign and last month accused him of breaking the law by failing to properly report incidents of child abuse at juvenile justice facilities. there s no evidence here that you ve accomplished anything. the vote of no confidence comes less than a week after juvenile correctional officers in columbia walked off the job in protest over many of the deficiencies identified in the recent report which harpootlian has called a damning indictment of south carolina s juvenile justice system. state lawmakers convened the subcommittee to review the audit shortly after its release in april and have met four times to take testimony from auditors and question pough about problems outlined in their report. pough was scheduled to testify again wednesday but had his testimony preempted by a succession of current and former employees who were given the opportunity to air their grievances with the agency and his leadership. several of the officers and teachers who spoke before the panel wednesday including lt. ricky dyckes jr. also attended a protest outside the broad river road detention complex last week. this is the worst that i have ever heard of any correctional facility operating. period said dyckes jr. a 10 year juvenile justice veteran and former department of corrections employee who testified that officers fear for their safety and are routinely forced to work 24 hour shifts without breaks due to severe manpower shortages. tuesday night a staff member was brutally assaulted after transporting juveniles from one facility to another and had to be hospitalized he said. he was thumped in his head and he was robbed by the juveniles. they went in his pocket and took his money dyckes jr. said. this is the kind of environment that is taking place at djj on the regular. pough who took questions from the senate panel after his workers spoke acknowledged the recent assault but said it did n t result from a lack of staffing. it was eight young people one staff the director said referring to the minimum juvenile to security staff ratio required by federal statute. we met the ratio but the young people decided to act out. pough who has refused calls to resign amid a deluge of worker complaints and recent incidents at juvenile justice facilities forcefully defended his leadership of the agency and said he was working hard to better the department and address employees concerns. staffing problems at the department run deep he acknowledged but questioned why so much attention was being paid to issues that predate his four year tenure. there s a lot of talk about how bad things are now but there s very little talk about how bad things were then. there s very little talk about how we ve built on years and years of badness pough said. nobody wants to go back to talk about when the roof started to leak and it was ignored and the hole got bigger and it was ignored and now the roof s caved in and it s under my watch. he said the department needed significant help and acknowledged it could be years before staff fully buy into his restorative justice approach but added that smaller changes had occurred and progress was being made. i m committed to this because i believe we re doing great work. i believe that we re on the cusp of making this change pough said. i believe that we ve partnered with the right people to bring about the desired results for this committee and for the state. pough said he d met with some of the staff members who left their posts friday and that many have since returned to work. he said he d attempted to address employees concerns about working conditions compensation and bonuses for new hires and promised that current employees would receive the same bonuses offered to new workers as long as money from unfilled positions remained available. because roughly 40 of juvenile correctional officer positions are currently vacant the agency has been able to use the money allocated for those positions to offer workers sign on and referral bonuses. in the aftermath of friday s walkout pough said the agency had moved some juveniles between dorms or facilities in an effort to consolidate existing manpower and was receiving staffing assistance from the department of corrections. juvenile justice officials also are in discussions with a private staffing contractor about hiring 10 additional officers per shift to work the gates staff control rooms and help with transportation at the broad river road complex so that trained employees can work directly with juveniles he said. the agency which already has the department of administration and state law enforcement division reviewing its policies and procedures also has begun working with corrections officials to review scheduling procedures and ensure employees are being deployed as efficiently as possible pough said. the director who has been criticized by lawmakers and staff for not taking as active a role at the detention complex as his predecessors denied he was rarely if ever seen at the facility. he said he meets with staff regularly corresponds with employees via a weekly newsletter and jumps into action when needed. a picture can be painted about me saying i do n t care but you know if you poll the audience it s not accurate. it s not accurate pough said running off a list of major disturbances he said he d responded to at the broad river road complex in recent years. i am boots on the ground very much. lawmakers question pough s leadership . despite pough s assurances that he was making improvements at the juvenile justice agency senators took the director to task wednesday and harshly criticized his stewardship of the department. what you ve described is yeah you know djj has always had its issues and its challenges and we re no different. because i am familiar too with djj under other leaders black and white republicans and democrats and this is the worst that i ve seen it. she told pough she was n t clear whether he was asking for more time to turn around the beleaguered agency or trying to explain that he d failed to reform the department in four years because the legislature had not adequately funded the agency. either way she said it was obvious that he d failed to show leadership in his role. this is n t rocket science mcleod said. for you to stand here and blame the media and blame the legislature for not providing you with the resources that you need to do the job is ridiculous. pough said he was simply seeking acknowledgment that despite myriad challenges good work was being done at the agency and real change was possible with a little patience and some support. i think that is leadership acknowledging that there s a need for human capital and trying to put things in place to acquire that human capital he said. brian adams r berkeley a retired police lieutenant commended pough for trying to reform the department but said he d already had four years in the post and it did n t sound like enough progress had been made. what really struck me is you had command staff come up and speak in front of you and that takes guts adams said. that s telling me there s some issues within the department because i do n t think i could ever see myself standing up in front of my chief and telling other people what they re doing wrong. harpootlian told pough it was past time for him to step down and questioned why gov. henry mcmaster who has stood by the director throughout the recent turmoil has not come to the same conclusion. your staff has lost faith in you the people that have testified here today have lost faith in you i ve lost faith in you he said. i do n t know why the governor has n t lost faith in you. a spokesman for mcmaster did not respond to a request for comment on pough s testimony or the senate panel s vote of no confidence in his leadership.

labour,"agency tennessee zinc miner fired for voicing safety worry . ap federal regulators have brought a complaint against a zinc mining company claiming that an employee in tennessee was illegally fired for making safety complaints about the mine. secretary of labor marty walsh filed the complaint earlier this month with the federal mine safety and health review commission against nyrstar gordonsville llc on behalf of worker richard waller. an administrative law judge in april approved the labor secretary s request for temporary reinstatement of waller s pay and benefits while the case over the cumberland mine in smith county proceeds. the complaint claims waller was fired for documenting unsafe conditions in the mine s shaft inspection book complaining to supervising staff about those conditions engaging in protected refusal to perform welding without a required fire extinguisher and speaking with a mine safety and health administration inspector who was on site at the mine. in an agreement signed by the company and attorneys for department of labor and waller instead of physically returning to work the mine worker is temporarily receiving his pay and benefits and can seek work elsewhere while his case proceeds. in statements in the case waller wrote that the form given to him during his firing said he was terminated for insubordination though the only discipline that should have remained on his record was a two day suspension in january 2021 for a violation of the lockout tagout policy to isolate energy sources before workers do mechanical or electrical work. he wrote that the company claimed that it adheres to a progressive discipline policy which he said the company did n t follow saying further that the policy has so many caveats it is meaningless. representatives from nyrstar did not immediately return email requests for comment on the complaint. the complaint seeks the expungement of the firing from waller s record reinstatement of employment full back pay with interest and benefits and a 20000 penalty. the federal mine safety and health act says mine workers ca n t be terminated discriminated against or interfered with for certain

lifestyle,"fort spokane they may have been paddling upstream but the wind was at their backs. their hand carved cedar canoes may have weighed 800 pounds and stretched 31 feet in length but they moved easily through the waters of the columbia river. the salmon may have been barred from those waters some 80 years ago but the spokane and colville tribal members who began the six day 60 mile journey from fort spokane to kettle falls on tuesday morning believe schools of salmon will one day follow them along the same route. and while colonialist forces have worked sometimes brutally to strip them of their native language they counted their strokes in salish made jokes in salish and sang in salish as they paddled between the reservations they were allotted when their ancestral territories were taken. the group of some 40 spokane and colville tribal members confronted the cruelty of their history before they launched gathering in a circle on the grounds of fort spokane once home to a government run boarding school where they were stripped of their culture and subjected to cruelty according to sulustu whose english name is barry moses and who addressed those assembled. indigenous people have long attempted to draw attention to the inhumanity of their often forced education in such schools but the issue came to renewed attention last month when the remains of more than 200 children were discovered at the site of a residential school in kamloops british columbia. and i m sure if we were to look at all the other schools sulustu said we d find many many more. he called for such searches to be conducted and for any remains to be returned to the tribes. it is also time according to sulustu to restore what the schools sought to eliminate. if there s any greater act of resistance he said then it s learning our languages. evidence of such resistance was on display everywhere as the group headed to the north side of the spokane river and prepared to begin their journey north to an annual salmon ceremony slated for sunday near the site of the now submerged kettle falls using their languages to speak in both snippets and extended exchanges. during the canoe journey we try to use our language as much as possible said craig hill the 22 year old making his maiden voyage as skipper of the spokane tribe s canoe. devon peone who teaches at the spokane language house in wellpinit used english however to explain the origin of the fifth annual canoe journey. he said an important impetus was virgil seymour a colville tribal elder from the sinixt band who had a vision of people paddling to the salmon ceremony but died just before the first one took place in 2016. also important peone said was the donation of the cedar logs that grew for over 700 years on the quinault reservation before being carved by the individual tribes of the area. the journey has persisted peone said because it offers an opportunity for reconnection and revitalization. it s important to reconnect to the water the land the elders but also to call the salmon home said peone who organizes the spokane tribe s canoe and often serves as its skipper. but we need a good clean home for the salmon to come home to. late last year colville tribal biologists observed the first spawning chinook salmon in the upper columbia river system in a generation. this spring spokane tribal biologists found a newly hatched salmon in tshimakain creek also spelled chamokane creek on the eastern edge of the spokane indian reservation. even so major challenges remain to restore historic salmon runs most significantly the dams that impound the columbia and prevent the fish from moving up and downstream. shelly boyd a sinixt who skippered the boat from her tribe said those obstacles can be overcome. the whole point is we re going to bring the salmon back she said. they re coming right after us. boyd though emphasized that the journey was about more than just the hard things. even so boyd said the journey offered an opportunity for members of indigenous communities and those outside them to reflect on how a paddle that begins at the site of a former residential boarding school and continues up a dammed body of water fits within a broader context. it s hard for us to recognize the things right in front of us she said. look at the river. look at the indigenous people in front of us.

other,"when talking about wildlife conservation biologists often emphasize the importance of protecting a healthy number of females in a given population largely because they re the ones that produce the next generation. males are sometimes seen as superfluous since their contribution to the species is often limited to a brief mating ritual with no role whatsoever in domestic activities like caring for their offspring. while that is yet another reason to occasionally feel ashamed to be male that s not the entire story. so as we celebrate father s day next week it s time to give credit to a few of the best fathers in the animal kingdom. i saw one last month when i hung a sheet in my yard and shined a black light on it to attract night flying moths. one of the first creatures to arrive was this frighteningly large aquatic bug with a reputation for occasionally biting the toes of people wading in local ponds. as i studied up on them i learned that some members of their family are considered devoted fathers. the female giant water bug glues about 150 eggs to the male s back and he guards them from predators and other potential hazards until they hatch. to protect the eggs from becoming moldy he occasionally climbs out of the water to air dry his charges. he even does something akin to pushups at the surface of the water with the eggs still on his back to ensure that the eggs are properly oxygenated. that s the kind of guy any female water bug would be proud to call her mate. these eel like fish that live in the nooks and crannies of boulder piles about 200 feet deep in new england waters are even scarier looking than giant water bugs with gnarly teeth and a mean grin. but when a female lays her eggs as many as 10000 in large piles hidden in the crevices of the boulders her mate stands guard to protect those eggs for up to nine months seldom eating or moving. during that time all of those gnarly teeth fall out and new equally gnarly ones grow in. red fox dads play a similarly important but very different fatherly role in supporting their offspring. they re in charge of teaching the little ones how to be foxes by showing them how to hide and how to capture food. sometimes the dads even set up foraging tests for their youngsters. he also brings food to his mate when she s nursing her pups. all of this is readily visible in some suburban neighborhoods where fox skills are being taught in area backyards. perhaps the best known animal fathers are seahorses including the lined seahorses found around eelgrass beds in narragansett bay. pairs of seahorses undertake a lengthy and complex courtship ritual after which the mother deposits her eggs in the father s pouch. he then broods the developing young for two or three weeks before releasing the hatchlings into the water. and then he does it again with the same monogamous mate. that s fatherhood at its best. while these examples are enlightening and worth highlighting as we celebrate our own fathers they aren t typical. more often than not males in the animal kingdom may look good like the brightly colored male birds but they aren t necessarily good for much more than a romp in the hay. happy father s day anyway. naturalist todd mcleish has been writing about wildlife and the environment for more than 25 years. his newest book is called return of the sea """

politics,"san diego ap the biden administration has quietly tasked six humanitarian groups with recommending which migrants should be allowed to stay in the instead of being rapidly expelled from the country under federal pandemic related powers that block people from seeking asylum. the groups will determine who is most vulnerable in mexico and their criteria has not been made public. it comes as large numbers of people are crossing the southern border and as the government faces intensifying pressure to lift the public health powers instituted by former president donald trump and kept in place by president joe biden during the coronavirus pandemic. several members of the consortium spoke to the associated press about the criteria and provided details of the system that have not been previously reported. the government is aiming to admit to the country up to 250 asylum seekers a day who are referred by the groups and is agreeing to that system only until july 31. by then the consortium hopes the biden administration will have lifted the public health rules though the government has not committed to that. so far a total of nearly 800 asylum seekers have been let in since may 3 and members of the consortium say there is already more demand than they can meet. the groups have not been publicly identified except for the international rescue committee a global relief organization. the others are london based save the children two based organizations hias and kids in need of defense and two mexico based organizations asylum access and the institute for women in migration according to two people with direct knowledge who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information was not intended for public release. asylum access which provides services to people seeing asylum in mexico characterized its role as minimal. the effort started in el paso texas and is expanding to nogales arizona. a similar but separate mechanism led by the american civil liberties union began in late march and allows 35 families a day into the united states at places along the border. the twin tracks are described by participating organizations as an imperfect transition from so called title 42 authority named for a section of an obscure 1944 public health law that trump used in march 2020 to effectively end asylum at the mexican border. with covid 19 vaccination rates rising biden is finding it increasingly difficult to justify the expulsions on public health grounds and faces demands to end it from the refugee agency and members of his own party and administration. the homeland security department said in a statement that its efforts involve close coordination with international and non governmental organizations in mexico to identify vulnerable people using government criteria and that it has final say on who gets in. it described its work with the groups as fluid and said it has n t publicly identified them to avoid giving them exposure. some consortium members are concerned that going public may cause their offices in mexico to be mobbed by asylum seekers overwhelming their tiny staffs and exposing them to potential threats and physical attacks from extortionists and other criminals. critics of the new selection processes say too much power is vested in a small number of organizations and that the effort is shrouded in secrecy without a clear explanation of how the groups were chosen. critics also say there are no assurances that the most vulnerable or deserving migrants will be chosen to seek asylum. the consortium was formed after the government asked the high commissioner for refugees office in mexico for the names of organizations with deep experience and capacity in mexico said sibylla brodzinsky a spokeswoman for the office. the groups say they are merely streamlining the process but that the vulnerable migrants cases can come from anywhere. in nogales arizona the international rescue committee is working with local organizations and using a program that connects to migrants via social media and smartphones to find people facing extreme life threatening situations said raymundo tamayo the group s director in mexico. it plans to refer up to 600 people a month to officials. special consideration is being given to people who have been in mexico a long time are in need of acute medical attention or who have disabilities are members of the lgbtq community or are non spanish speakers though each case is being weighed on its unique circumstances tamayo said. aclu attorney lee gelernt said advocacy groups are in a very difficult position because they need to essentially rank the desperation of people but he insisted it was temporary. the government he said cannot farm out the asylum system. migration experts not involved in the process have questioned how the groups determine who is eligible. it has been murky said jessica bolter an analyst at the nonpartisan migration policy institute who believes the administration is trying to quietly be humane without encouraging more people to come a balancing act she doubts will succeed. setting out clear and accurate information about how and who might get in might lead to fewer migrants making the trip so there s not this game of chance that kind of seems to be in place right now bolter said. border authorities recorded the highest number of encounters with migrants in more than 20 years in april though many were repeat crossers who had previously been expelled from the country. the number of children crossing the border alone also is hovering at all time highs. against that backdrop some advocates are seeing the makings of the humane asylum system that biden promised during his campaign. details have been elusive with administration officials saying they need time. susana coreas who fled el salvador was among those identified as vulnerable and allowed into the united states last month. coreas spent more than a year in ciudad juarez waiting to apply for asylum but was barred by the public health order.

religion,"admired by everyone from john milton to nick cave the anatomy of melancholy has always been a text that has dazzled and confounded its readers in equal measure. now exactly 400 years after it was published an academic has painstakingly traced the meaning of thousands of its sphinxlike allusions enigmatic references and arcane quotations allowing robert burton s famous text to be fully understood for the very first time. dr angus gowland of university college london told the observer there are now only nine known mysteries and riddles of the text left to solve. in total burton used more than 13000 quotations and references in his book to discuss the causes and symptoms of melancholy a term that in 1621 covered a catch all category of anything that s gone wrong with your mind and to explain the various physical philosophical and emotional remedies his readers should use as cures. provided by the guardian frontispiece from robert burton s the anatomy of melancholy london 1836. photograph universal history archive getty . in some ways the text is like an early modern self help book said gowland. the idea is that when you read this you ll come across parts burton says you will recognise. and when you see something about yourself that s when he thinks you should pay attention and implement the kind of remedies being presented. there s a kind of therapeutic aspect to the text a pre modern notion of self knowledge. over the centuries its legion of admirers has included literary figures such as samuel johnson john keats george eliot virginia woolf and more recently philip pullman. one of the reasons it has appealed to people is because it is not about a particular disease but about any condition of irrationality or strong and destructive emotions. and it presents ways of thinking about these conditions that are not just medical but also moral and spiritual he said. despite its notoriety as a groundbreaking work some of the quotations statements and references in the work have long baffled readers. gowland has spent the past 10 years unravelling most of these. their meanings will be revealed when a new penguin classics edition of the text edited by gowland is published on 1 july . the purpose of the edition is to make it accessible not just to scholars but to the general reader who is interested in this kind of book gowland said. all the obscure terms and archaic and obsolete language has been glossed systematically for the first time to allow you to read and understand burton s words properly as they were originally intended. provided by the guardian english scholar robert burton in 1628. his most famous work is the anatomy of melancholy published in 1621. photograph hulton archive getty images . for example scholars have typically claimed that burton and his contemporaries believed melancholy was caused internally by black bile in the human body. but gowland reveals that the vocabulary employed by burton particularly his use of the word artificial indicates that importantly . burton also thought melancholy was caused by factors external to the body and that every living organism was susceptible to it. similarly burton describes the malady of melancholy as an ill habit . this has typically been misunderstood by scholars and readers gowland said because the term habit used to have a technical sense when applied to the physical body. when burton uses it it means physical condition or constitution . this is essential for the literal understanding of the text in various places he said. other riddles that have now been solved include what burton meant when he cryptically advised his readers don t crush the basil. previously scholars thought it meant don t make scorpions . gowland traced the phrase to a latin saying published in an obscure text in 1590 and discovered what burton actually meant was be gentle with yourself or with others. there are loads of examples where the text was there people read it and no one knew what it meant added gowland. it s possible this was deliberate. one way of making sense of all the unattributed quotations and obscure allusions is to see them as puzzles left by burton for his readers and for posterity. he likes to play games with his readers. whatever type of melancholy a reader is suffering from whether it is a broken heart religious superstition a bereavement serious depression or anything that would now be viewed as a mood disorder there is a remedy in the book for it. gowland hopes the new 1376 page edition will open up the masterpiece to new readers but also satisfy the yearnings of existing enthusiasts who surprised publishers in recent years by ensuring earlier reprints sold extremely well . the number of emails i ve had from people who love the book asking when it s coming out and getting impatient it s got this random fanbase of people who really love it he said. many of the remedies for melancholy discussed in the book from the importance of talking to friends to the health benefits of taking scented baths are coming back into fashion especially following the isolation of recent lockdowns and restrictions on socialising. there s a resonance with what s happening today because solitude is a condition which melancholy follows like a shadow. in fact burton viewed melancholy as a pathology of solitude. his last words that aren t a quotation in the book are be not solitary be not idle.

religion,"the boulder international film festival kicks off next week and with it always comes an influx of filmmakers eager to connect collaborate and leave even more inspired than when they first pick up their festival passes. academy award winning director louie psihoyos returns to boulder international film festival june 24 27 for the colorado premiere of his documentary mission joy finding happiness in troubled times that will be screened at chautauqua auditorium on june 27 as part of biff s closing night. louie psihoyos courtesy photo . academy award winning director louie psihoyos who once called boulder home will make the journey back to the front range to screen his latest documentary mission joy finding happiness in troubled times produced by peggy callahan. the heartwarming film that gives an intimate look at the playful friendship between spiritual icons the dalai lama and desmond tutu will be shown on biff s closing night at 7 45 june 27 at chautauqua auditorium. post film psihoyos will sit down with ron bostwick of the colorado sound for a q a. not only did psihoyos 2009 documentary the cove take home an oscar it brilliantly exposed the yearly mass dolphin killings in taiji wakayama japan. permission to film wasn t granted by the japanese government forcing crew to utilize a bevy of sly tactics including hiding cameras within fake rocks. as executive director of boulder based nonprofit the oceanic preservation society psihoyos an avid scuba diver continues to craft films that spotlight critical issues faced by our fragile planet in order to facilitate change. we caught up with the iowa born activist and former national geographic society photographer to find out what he loves about the hometown feel of biff the profound and unexpected impact making mission joy had on him and what future projects audiences can expect from him next. daily camera i know boulder was your home for many years. what are you most looking forward to about returning for a brief visit to attend biff any must dos on your list for your visit back to the front range . louie psihoyos i m looking forward to seeing some old friends and walking around to see how the town has changed but i m excited to see the reaction to the film for the boulder audience live. over the last year we ve been testing the film on zoom audiences and it s a really strange experience to watch people in their homes watching the film with all their real life distractions children cell phones having dinner. it will be a treat to watch people in a theater watch the film with a community especially a community like boulder that has gone through so much in the last year. dc what would you say was the most rewarding aspect of making mission joy finding happiness in troubled times and what are you hoping viewers take away from the doc . lp the best part was working with talented people and trying to get the best out of each other with this compelling material. our team started by getting two of the most revered spiritual leaders in the world together for a week and asking them the big questions. we had 15 hours of dialogues of archbishop tutu and the dalai lama and after reviewing them i found myself physically changed. i thought about everything differently. my priorities snapped into place dealing with difficulties became easier and i learned to have more joy. this has been a hard time for people around the world hopefully a lot of people will have similar transformations after seeing the film. dc seems like 2020 was a year when many folks discovered new shows films and documentaries and had more time to binge watch. what are some of your recent favorites that you found particularly moving or highly entertaining . lp i watch tons of documentaries but my guilty pleasure is i like a lot of the series and action films series. i m always trying to imagine applying structures of narrative films to our docs. there s a reason rolling stone magazine said the cove was like a cross between the bourne identity and flipper. racing extinction was highly influenced by the bond films. the tesla we had modified for the film was outfitted with disappearing license plates an electroluminescent paint job a forward looking infrared camera with a mechanical gimbal that came out of the frunk and the projector on a robotic arm that came off the back hatch. it was a better vehicle than anything bond ever drove because ours was real and had some real world impact. racing extinction led to laws passed that protect some of the world s most endangered species and it is cited as the inspiration to several leaders in the youth climate movement. dc how would you say biff compares to other film festivals . lp this will be the first film we made that didn t premiere at sundance the timing didn t work out for us to register but it s hard to navigate those large festivals cannes venice tribeca they re spread out over many miles they re big city expensive and getting into a nearby hotel or restaurant is a mission. i prefer the small and medium size festivals like telluride mountain film palm springs savannah and biff that are centered around supportive film communities. it s easier to meet people easier to get into see great films and you can get a reasonable priced hotel and the restaurants aren t overpacked. dc are there any current projects you are working on that should be on our radar lp all of our projects involve trying to scale social change. we re creating an epic three day projection event for the un on the east side of the secretariat building in new york in advance of the next cop conference of the parties . kind of like the projection event we did for the climax of racing extinction but 100 times bigger. we re still fundraising and we need to acquire and create nine hours of content with the mandate of inspiring a billion people to solve for climate change inequality and severe poverty. it s like the mission of a bond film but we really are trying to help save the world or at least keep from it getting less worse for future generations. we have 10 years to get on the fast track to solving these issues or i m afraid the next generation will suffer greatly. in the west summer is now called fire season. in a few decades coral reefs will disappear if we don t start acting now. the solutions are here now and they re upgrades to our lives we just need to accelerate the change. with our past projection events we had over billion media views. the un is now challenging us to convert those views to action. we re doing a film about a sisterhood of female big wave surfers at mavericks the legendary surf break that won pay parity for their sport. it s really a film about female empowerment. we re also making a film called the last place on earth. it s the last place where wild elephants tigers rhinos and orangutans are found in the wild and we tell the stories of indigenous activists there who are working to save their habitat from illegal palm oil plantations. i m also co directing a film about plastic pollution solutions. films are the most powerful peaceful weapon for social change we have and we have a very good track record for making films that really do change the world and are also entertaining. the cove won an oscar and became the first documentary to sweep all the film guilds but more importantly it also helped reduce the killing of small cetaceans for human consumption over 90 . racing extinction was just nominated the best environmental film of the decade by the green film network an alliance of the top environmental film festivals and has ignited a movement. in the first 30 days the game changers a film about top vegan athletes was on netflix searches for plant based diet went up 350 worldwide. my organization ops really isn t just making movies. we re creating social change with the most powerful weapon in the world.

religion,"world environment day 2021 exploring the influence of environment on writers . the relationship between humans and their environment is very intimate and interesting. how close an individual could be with their surroundings is something no one can decide or put a pin on. in addition how someone behaves in a particular environment how comfortable they feel in it and most importantly how the environment affects a writer all are extremely enrapturing to explore. many writers and poets have described their close affinity with nature and the environment through their works. also in the case of writers the environment is not only restricted to scenic places with lots of greenery. it could also include dirty rooms shabby pubs and depressing workstations. how exactly these environments affect a writer is something we will be delving into. writers and their respective environments diana fuss professor of literature at princeton university in her book the sense of an interior four writers and the rooms that shaped them studied four well known authors living and writing spaces. fuss describes the smoky ambiance of sigmund freud s consulting room the view from emily dickinson s bedroom window the inhospitality of helen keller s house and the claustrophobic atmosphere of marcel proust s bedroom. the purpose of the book was to understand how the writers experienced their writing spaces. giving the readers an insight into this fuss noted that proust who suffered from asthma lived in a cork lined room with heavy drapes to keep out natural light and air. the author of remembrance of things past a work permeated in sensory experience found it necessary to suspend the senses to write about them fuss wrote. on the other hand dickinson s corner bedroom had the best light and the best views of any in the house. the view helped her with a telescopic power which led to her producing diverse pieces of literature. thus going by fuss s observations the environment does affect writers and their works. how did environment and nature influence literary geniuses by the middle of the 19th century henry david thoreau and ralph waldo emerson began to reinterpret the significance of nature and our relationship to it. these writers laid the groundwork for an evolution in environmental thought and ethics in which the environment was seen as more than just a natural resource. for example in walden and some other writings thoreau pointed out that our natural environment had far more to offer than material resources to be exploited. rather thoreau noted that nature and the environment were sources of spiritual truth and support. if we consider tagore nature is a consistent motif of his literary oeuvre. his poems particularly some verses from gitanjali depict his intense affection for nature and its beauty. in fact he wrote poems plays short stories and also a separate group of lyrics in the form of poems for songs under the name of prakriti parjaay focusing on the need to protect nature as well as our mother earth. in addition at santiniketan tagore started the festival of the earth through brikkharopan planting of trees in 1927 at which the students would sing and read his poems. even william wordsworth the pioneer of romanticism repeatedly emphasizes the importance of nature to an individual s intellectual and spiritual development. a good relationship with nature helps individuals connect to both the spiritual and the social worlds. as wordsworth explains in the prelude a love of nature can lead to a love of humankind. therefore nature and the environment are the driving forces behind several renowned writers and poets. to summarize its importance in their lives the following lines by the english poet and politician lord byron are the aptest. there is pleasure in the pathless woods there is rapture in the lonely shore there is society where none intrudes by the deep sea and music in its roar i love not man the less but nature kartikeya shankar .

religion,"in the beginning was a word and the word was freedom. when ride hailing and delivery apps like uber and grab first arose five years ago and with them a fast growing gig economy the message they preached was the freedom to work the hours you choose. no boss no fixed hours merely a system that rewards the virtues of hustling with fast earnings. no surprise then that believers flocked to this promised land of empowerment in droves. post pandemic the rose tinted glasses are off. while questions about the unregulated industry have popped up over the years this pandemic has made clear how vulnerable these workers are. though we rely on food and goods deliveries more than ever gig workers earnings are inching downward even as their risk of virus exposure climbs. while more are turning to delivery gigs after job losses they find scarcely any support from these companies and their ever changing fee structures. it seems timely that the widow of a delivery driver in singapore who allegedly died of exhaustion recently came forward to share her story. round the world other horrific tales of death by overwork have surfaced. these thorny issues form the backdrop for t0701 an unsettling play by local artist collective zeugma for this year s singapore international festival of arts sifa . now available for streaming on demand the play unfolds in a not too distant society ruled by corporate giant megahcorp. megahcorp s too close for comfort slogan is always with you and that pretty much sums up their privacy big brother vibes anyone . in megahcorp however deliveryman jati irsyad dawood trusts. a pmd delivery personnel aka deper he s driven by the belief that his gig work is the road to a better life for himself and his mother. and as we watch megahcorp s slick job rhetoric on screen it s hard not to see why. uncannily reminiscent of a navy recruitment video their ads are sprinkled with empowering clich s tailored to hook in millennials. think serving the community believe in yourself and best of all the world is in the power of your hands even if jati has to ask his device for permission before resting for the night. on the other side of the fence is a small freedom movement led by jati s own mother rabiah gloria tan a bomoh who resists the all knowing megahcorp with her own brand of magic. installing spirits into devices she creates t0701s pronounced toy yols charms for a digital age that can glitch megahcorp s location tracking. for misfits like azizah indumathi tamilselvan and versace izzul irfan this means precious pockets of space where they can simply chill out without penalties from the system. but as her son climbs higher up the ranks their clashing views on freedom and survival hurtles them toward betrayal. blending digital animation with live performance the play trains a sharp spotlight on the psychological tricks that keep workers running on the underpaid hamster wheel. this goes beyond touting ideals and includes common reward structures like levelling up for bonus perks the same features that make video games so addictive. on the audience s end we watch jati s delivery avatar lost in what resembles a retro racing game on screen fueled by peppy music and high speed thrills. the adrenaline rush is so reflexive you almost don t notice how repetitive the gamescape is jati s avatar is on a race to nowhere speeding down an endlessly scrolling road. how then can we break free from the spell of the gig economy t0701 offers one bold possibility the kind of traditional roots and spiritual healing embodied by rabiah the bomoh. can mysticism stand up against mega corporations in our app dominated era it s not hard to foresee the answer.

science,"such swirling masses of matter gave shape to the earliest forms of carbon precursors to molecules some scientists say are connected to the synthesis of the earliest forms of life on earth. for nearly half a century astrophysicists and organic chemists have been on the hunt for the origins of c6h6 the benzene ring an elegant hexagonal molecule comprised of 6 carbon and 6 hydrogen atoms. astrophysicists say that the benzene ring could be the fundamental building block of polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons or pahs the most basic materials formed from the explosion of dying carbon rich stars. that swirling mass of matter would eventually give shape to the earliest forms of carbon precursors to molecules some scientists say are connected to the synthesis of the earliest forms of life on earth. paradoxically pahs have a dark side too. the industrial processes behind crude oil refineries and the inner workings of gas powered combustion engines can emit pahs which can snowball into toxic air pollutants like soot. but now researchers at lawrence berkeley national laboratory berkeley lab the university of hawaii at manoa and florida international university have demonstrated the first real time measurement using lab based methods of unstable particles called free radicals reacting under cosmic conditions prompting elementary carbon and hydrogen atoms to coalesce into primal benzene rings. the researchers say that their findings recently published in the journal science advances are key to understanding how the universe evolved with the growth of carbon compounds. that insight could also help the car industry make cleaner combustion engines. senior staff scientist musahid ahmed left and postdoctoral researcher wenchao lu near the advanced light source als at berkeley lab on may 21 2021. they used a special technique which ahmed adapted 10 years ago at the als to stop a so called radical propargyl self reaction before soot forms. credit thor swift berkeley lab . a type of free radical called the propargyl radical c3h3 is extremely reactive due to its propensity for losing an electron and has been implicated in soot formation for decades. researchers believed that the recombination of two free propargyl radicals c3h3 c3h3 gave rise to the first aromatic ring benzene. the current study is the first demonstration of the so called radical propargyl self reaction under astrochemical and combustion conditions. using a high temperature coin sized chemical reactor called the hot nozzle the researchers simulated the high pressure high temperature environment inside a combustion engine as well as the hydrocarbon rich atmosphere of saturn s moon titan and observed the formation of isomers molecules with the same chemical formula but different atomic structures from two propargyl radicals leading up to the benzene ring. the hot nozzle technique which co senior author musahid ahmed senior staff scientist in berkeley lab s chemical sciences division adapted 10 years ago at berkeley lab s advanced light source als for synchrotron experiments relies on vacuum ultraviolet vuv spectroscopy to detect individual isomers. the als is a type of particle accelerator known as a synchrotron that generates extremely bright beams of light ranging from infrared through x rays. the researchers steered the technique to arrest the propargyl radical self reaction which unfolds within microseconds just before larger pahs and subsequent soot form. the compelling result supports predictions from experiments led by co senior author ralf kaiser professor of chemistry at the university of hawaii at manoa and quantum chemistry simulations formulated by co senior author alexander mebel professor of chemistry at florida international university. they believe that the finding could one day lead to cleaner combustion engines. having more efficient gas engines some analysts say is still important because it may take another 25 years before we can replace the entire fleet of gas cars with electric vehicles evs . furthermore equipping airplanes and the gas powered component of hybrid plug in evs with cleaner combustion engines could help reduce co2 emissions contributing to climate change. ahmed said he plans to extend the methods employed to study pah growth and probe other systems of relevance to the doe mission such as water desalination and environmental science. we d also like to go and catch a buckyball c60 one of nature s biggest clues to the secrets behind symmetry ahmed said. kaiser added that their research could help astronomers plot a carbon map of the universe and zero in on the cosmic origins behind dna s carbon frameworks. co authors on the paper include long zhao at the university of hawaii at manoa

synthesis of the earliest forms of life on earth. paradoxically pahs have a dark side too. the industrial processes behind crude oil refineries and the inner workings of gas powered combustion engines can emit pahs which can snowball into toxic air pollutants like soot. exactly how the first benzene ring formed from stars in the early universe and how combustion engines trigger the chemical reaction that alters the benzene ring into soot particle pollutants have long mystified scientists. but now researchers at lawrence berkeley national laboratory berkeley lab the university of hawaii at manoa and florida international university have demonstrated the first real time measurement using lab based methods of unstable particles called free radicals reacting under cosmic conditions prompting elementary carbon and hydrogen atoms to coalesce into primal benzene rings. the researchers say that their findings recently published in the journal science advances are key to understanding how the universe evolved with the growth of carbon compounds. that insight could also help the car industry make cleaner combustion engines. senior staff scientist musahid ahmed left and postdoctoral researcher wenchao lu near the advanced light source als at berkeley lab on may 21 2021. they used a special technique which ahmed adapted 10 years ago at the als to stop a so called radical propargyl self reaction before soot forms. credit thor swift berkeley lab . a type of free radical called the propargyl radical c3h3 is extremely reactive due to its propensity for losing an electron and has been implicated in soot formation for decades. researchers believed that the recombination of two free propargyl radicals c3h3 c3h3 gave rise to the first aromatic ring benzene. the current study is the first demonstration of the so called radical propargyl self reaction under astrochemical and combustion conditions. using a high temperature coin sized chemical reactor called the hot nozzle the researchers simulated the high pressure high temperature environment inside a combustion engine as well as the hydrocarbon rich atmosphere of saturn s moon titan and observed the formation of isomers molecules with the same chemical formula but different atomic structures from two propargyl radicals leading up to the benzene ring. the hot nozzle technique which co senior author musahid ahmed senior staff scientist in berkeley lab s chemical sciences division adapted 10 years ago at berkeley lab s advanced light source als for synchrotron experiments relies on vacuum ultraviolet vuv spectroscopy to detect individual isomers. the als is a type of particle accelerator known as a synchrotron that generates extremely bright beams of light ranging from infrared through x rays. the researchers steered the technique to arrest the propargyl radical self reaction which unfolds within microseconds just before larger pahs and subsequent soot form. the compelling result supports predictions from experiments led by co senior author ralf kaiser professor of chemistry at the university of hawaii at manoa and quantum chemistry simulations formulated by co senior author alexander mebel professor of chemistry at florida international university. they believe that the finding could one day lead to cleaner combustion engines. having more efficient gas engines some analysts say is still important because it may take another 25 years before we can replace the entire fleet of gas cars with electric vehicles evs . furthermore equipping airplanes and the gas powered component of hybrid plug in evs with cleaner combustion engines could help reduce co2 emissions contributing to climate change. ahmed said he plans to extend the methods employed to study pah growth and probe other systems of relevance to the doe mission such as water desalination and environmental science. we d also like to go and catch a buckyball c60 one of nature s biggest clues to the secrets behind symmetry ahmed said. kaiser added that their research could help astronomers plot a carbon map of the universe and zero in on the cosmic origins behind dna s carbon frameworks. co authors on the paper include long zhao at the university of hawaii at manoa wenchao lu at berkeley lab and marsel zagidullin and valeriy azyazov at samara national research university in russia. the advanced light source is a doe user facility at berkeley lab. and its scientists have been recognized with 14 nobel prizes. today berkeley lab researchers develop sustainable energy and environmental solutions create useful new materials advance the frontiers of computing and probe the mysteries of life matter and the universe. scientists from around the world rely on the lab s facilities for

science,"another ship called the mayflower is set to make its way across the atlantic ocean this week but it won t be carrying english pilgrims or any people at all. when the mayflower autonomous ship leaves its home port in plymouth england to attempt the world s first fully autonomous transatlantic voyage it will have a highly trained captain and a navigator versed in the rules of avoiding collisions at sea on board both controlled by artificial intelligence ai . the ship s ai captain was developed by ibm and is guided by an expert system whose code is used widely by the financial sector. the technology could someday help crewed vessels navigate difficult situations and facilitate low cost exploration of the oceans that cover 70 percent of the earth s surface. over its roughly two week trip the mayflower sea drone will sail through the isles of scilly and over the site of the lost titanic to land in plymouth massachusetts as the colonists on the first mayflower did more than 400 years ago. this sleek new vessel however will carry experiments instead of people and has more room for experiments because it has been designed without sleeping quarters a galley or a bathroom. right now it s full to the brim brett phaneuf a managing director at msubs which built the mayflower for the non profit promare and its partner ibm told attendees at the may xponential conference held by the association for unmanned vehicle systems international auvsi . there are a host of additional companies individuals and universities that have contributed experimental technology and data gathering equipment phaneuf said. as a result the mayflower will be able to study sea levels measure wave height and gather water samples for testing at regular intervals throughout its voyage. though the mayflower won t be taking any side trips on this voyage the ship s artificial intelligence ai systems enable it to change course on its own if for example a science experiment finds something that merits further investigation credit tom barnes for ibm promare the mayflower will also do pollution sampling and document water chemistry. on board will be a holographic microscope for scanning water samples for microplastics bits of plastic 5mm or less that are harmful to ocean life. to determine water chemistry one of the experiments will literally taste the water with a test originally devised to uncover counterfeit wine and whiskey. you can dip the tongue into the liquid and it will give you the exact chemical profile of the liquid that you re looking at lenny bromberg ibm s programme director for automation intelligence and decision management told al jazeera. the mayflower will also be using hydrophones to listen for whales. ibm working with the jupiter research foundation and plymouth university has created models of the various types of whales and other cetaceans found in the north atlantic. with those models said phaneuf we ll be able to determine species and number of animals plus their location and general environment. though the mayflower won t be taking any side trips on this voyage the ship s ai systems enable it to change course on its own if for example a science experiment finds something that merits further investigation. don scott who is one of the lead engineers on the mayflower project said the ai captain will have the ability to direct operations as needed which is a really key distinction that separates this from other types of platforms . the science experiments aren t just passengers on the mayflower scott chief technology officer of marine ai told al jazeera. to get to that point ibm has been using its visual inspection technology and images of what the mayflower might find out in the ocean to train the ai captain andy stanford clark ibm uk and ireland s chief technology officer told the xponential audience. if there is something to be debugged or heaven forbid an accident we can say why did you make that decision and it ll explain exactly why it made that decision. andy stanford clark ibm uk and ireland chief technology officer . using a digital simulation a sort of twin of the ocean researchers threw the images in front of the ai captain s virtual cameras to teach it what to do in different situations. that s really where our training ground is for giving us the confidence the ai captain will do the right thing when it comes across something that it hasn t seen before stanford clark said during the conference. the mayflower s ai captain can now take in information from the ship s camera plus its radar ibm s weather service as well as coastal maps and the telemetry broadcast by ships through their automatic identification systems. the ai captain puts these parameters plus other factors such as the vessel s battery power the wind speed and direction into a big optimiser stanford clark explained. the system then generates a response he said and given the constraints decides what s the next best thing you can do where should you go at what speed and in what direction . but an ai system s decision making process can be unclear and marine travel is a regulated activity where understanding how a decision is made is essential so the team took it one step further. it added an ibm operational decision manager odm a rules based expert system with an extensive history in the financial industry that stanford clark said was very very good at parsing rules . the team fed the odm the rules from the convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs so it would know the rules of the sea. the science experiments are n t just passengers on the mayflower. don scott marine ai chief technology officer . and because the odm is a rules based system it has full explainability stanford clark said and is able to provide an audit trail of what it decided . if there is something to be debugged or heaven forbid an accident we can say why did you make that decision and it ll explain exactly why it made that decision he said. it s that technology that intrigues larry mayer a professor and the director of the center for coastal and ocean mapping at the university of new hampshire and one of the programme leads for the seabed 2030 project. this is the big and difficult stuff mayer told al jazeera. i think we ll all be very very interested to see how well that works and i m hoping very much that it does work well.

science,"james hillier foundation scholarships  valued at 20 000 over four years have been presented to nicole mcswain left of paris district high school  william ratelband of st. john s college  and brianna thomas of bci. the scholarships are awarded annually to three exceptional brantford and brant county high school students who are entering university to study science. amazed and grateful are among the reactions of three area high school students chosen to receive this year s james hillier foundation scholarships. they are brianna thomas  an 18 year old student at brantford collegiate institute nicole mcswain  an 18 year old student at paris district high school and william ratelband  an 18 year old st. john s college student. separately  thomas earned an 80 000 schulich leader scholarship. she is one of only 100 recipients in canada. the hillier foundation was established 25 years ago by dr. james hillier of brantford  who co developed the electron microscope in 1938 and held more than 40 patents over his lifetime. a local group organized the collection of funds to get the scholarship program started  with hillier  a graduate of bci and the university of toronto  making a matching donation. he felt that if he hadn t had some help from local teachers  and a scholarship  that he wouldn t have been able to go to university and achieve what he did  peter dennis  chair of the foundation s scholarship committee  said of hillier. he wanted to make sure kids from brantford and brant county would have the opportunity to get to university. two students are nominated each year by teachers at each of the six high schools in brantford and brant county. the foundation s scholarship committee reviews the 12 applicants  interviews six and selects three to receive the scholarship which is worth up to 20 000 over four years for students working on an undergraduate degree in sciences. to date  71 students have received over 1 177 000 in financial support from the foundation. thomas said she is super grateful for the hillier scholarship. it means a lot to me  said thomas  who will attend the university of waterloo s physical sciences co op program  majoring in life physics. i know i want to do some form or research  but i don t know what problem i want to tackle yet  she said. i want to do something innovative that can help a lot of people and make some positive change through science. thomas  who grade 12 average is 99 per cent  lists biotechnology and material sciences as areas of interest. she has looked into the applications of 3d printing in medicine and is considering working toward creating more environmentally friendly or biodegradable materials. she said she has liked science from a young age  when she and her father would do experiments in their home  including the typical baking soda and vinegar volcano  or playing with circuits. thomas attended a weeklong seeds program on pathology at kingston s queen s university prior to starting high school. it was the first time i learned in depth about science  and from that point on i knew i wanted to do research. thomas also enjoys reading classic novels  and visual arts. brenda csordas  head of the science department at bci  taught thomas biology and chemistry over three years. she recognizes the importance of science and credible research  she said of her student. her research skills are absolutely incredible. csordas said thomas skills go beyond science  extending into digital and visual arts. thomas said the schulich scholarship will be super helpful to her academic career. it s amazing to not have to worry about the financial aspect as much  and focus on studying. the schulich award  launched in 2012  is canada s largest scholarship for science  technology  engineering and math. mcswain said she feels amazed by her hillier award. it s a great honour to be one of the recipients of the scholarship. she said she is excited to be attending to the university of toronto in september for the life sciences program  which is known for its research. i like the path of molecular genetics and neuroscience because i did a research paper on alzheimer s disease and diet  said mcswain  adding that she would like to work towards a treatment for the disease. the research paper provided the opportunity to be paired with an assistant professor at the university of montreal through a research co op run by the foundation of student science and technology. while maintaining a 96 average throughout high school  mcswain also found time to help fellow students with math and science as a volunteer in the credit recovery course. she also ran several campaigns in the school s peer2we club to support charities  and knitted baby hats that were donated to local hospitals. she said he hopes to be able to contribute to the field of scientific research  either through an institute or as a professor conducting her own research. ratelband said he feels really great about receiving the scholarship. it s going to help out a lot with university expenses  such as text books  he said. i really hope to be pursuing a graduate degree as well  so it will really help with that. ratelband will attend the university of waterloo in september in the honours math program where he hopes to pursue a double major in mathematical physics and computer science. he said he s always held an interest in math  but started thinking recently about practical problems or fields where they could be applied. ratelband  with a per cent average  gave credit to mathematics department head robert todd for helping him with extracurricular math contests held by the university of waterloo. he also is active in high school sports  having won awards at the county

sport,"canucks assistant brad shaw . travis green pictured will be aided by the hiring of brad shaw as a canucks assistant coach. photo by bruce bennett getty images . when brad shaw wasn t afforded an opportunity to interview as a replacement for departed columbus head coach john tortorella the assistant was surprisingly not retained by the nhl club vancouver canucks head coach travis green quickly sought permission to interview the free agent. what the blue jackets may have lost in their curious decision is what the canucks hoped to have gained wednesday in hiring the well travelled and highly respected shaw as a key assistant to green. the former defensive defenceman who logged 377 games with four nhl teams hasn t only guided top blueliners in a trio of coaching stops his ability to deploy responsible mindsets will resonate with a club that has to stop the bleeding. the league s 26th ranked defence and 17th rated penalty kill will get a boost from shaw s knowledge because the jackets sported the best kill in the 2018 19 season. he was also instrumental in helping seth jones zach werenski and vladislav gavrikov develop into top tier defencemen and reliable rearguards. it s why shaw s name popped up in the past to fill head coaching vacancies in arizona new york rangers buffalo and new jersey and why the canucks will deploy the 57 year old cambridge ont. native in an expanded role. nolan baumgartner will continue to work with defencemen and run the penalty kill but shaw won t be far away for some sage advice while helping direct forwards and the power play. brad brings a lot to the table said green. everyone looks at him like he s a defensive coach but he s a lot more than that. he s a very sharp hockey mind and is going to be able to touch a lot of areas of our team and be a good influence on our staff. we ve baumgartner and green been together for four years and sometimes a different point of view and different set of eyes is helpful. that was a big part of it and i really enjoy talking to people who have a mind for the game. and as a coach you want to be challenged and broaden your mind and ideas. he s a new voice for me and somebody i can lean on and he ll have some good words for baumer. columbus blue jackets head coach john tortorella stands in the bench in the game against the detroit red wings in may 2021. photo by aaron doster usa today sports . an example of shaw s expanded capabilities came in the 2019 playoffs. he worked with tortorella and assistant brad larsen who will interview to replace tortorella and the trio devised a plan that completely choked the tampa bay lightning winners of the president s trophy. a shocking first round sweep of the high octane lightning who had four of the league s top six scorers and were held to eight series goals was made possible by a staying above the puck approach and mucking and grinding through the neutral zone. it worked for the first round but the jackets were eliminated in six games by the boston bruins in the second. still shaw made a statement that he wasn t a one dimensional coach. the defensive side is something i ve done for a long time and always had a huge interest in he said. your defence has a big role and how they see the game react and finding solutions intrigues me and always will. it s always a challenge to get that message across. i know how i want players to play with habits and attention to detail. to have my hands in everything and have a little bit of a different job description is exciting. with baumer i hope to augment him in different ways by getting my point across and not being offensive. it s getting to a comfort level where you can say what s on your mind and by being totally honest we ll get further ahead. for the defence and forwards certain habits are important across the board. at times i ve been told i m too detailed or to finite. i ve gotten better and learned simplicity is a real important aspect and coaching five years with torts is as simple as it can get. those who really got to know shaw label him as a super nice guy . if anything he tends to be a perfectionist and a constant drilling of fundamentals might affect some but the canucks could use that right now. this is a steal for the canucks said a jackets insider. you ll see results pretty quick. the canucks also added kyle gustafson as an assistant and special assignment coach. he was assistant general manager and associate coach of the whl portland winterhawks and his connection with green dates to working the junior bench together. while assistants jason king goalie coach ian clark and video coach darryl seward were also re signed newell brown was jettisoned as the power play architect which speaks to shaw s heightened role. clark was reportedly rewarded with a whopping five year extension for turning thatcher demko into a bonafide starter and tailoring micheal dipietro s acrobatic game to be more effective at the pro level. chris higgins will resume his role as assistant director of player development after the former canucks winger supported the coaching staff and development coach this season.

sport,"francesco molinari spent the week before christmas together in italy in 2019 not realizing then it would be 18 months before the brothers would see each other again because of travel restrictions brought on by the covid 19 pandemic. was n t expecting the open to be the occasion francesco said thursday. the brothers played the open together in 2010 at pebble beach and in 2011 at congressional. that was when 40 year old edoardo was having some of his best years and they were ryder cup teammates in wales in 2010. since then edoardo has struggled and it was n t too long ago that he was outside the top 600 in the world. but without a open qualifier in england this year because of travel issues related to the covid 19 pandemic the usga offered 10 spots through a three tournament points list on the european tour. edoardo tied for the eighth in the british masters and was a runner up at the european open in germany earning his spot at torrey pines. francesco 38 has a five year exemption from his 2018 british open victory. during the pandemic edoardo was in italy. francesco flew home to london and could n t get to italy and then last summer moved his family to los angeles. the last year and a half has been very difficult edoardo said. so that s why i came a day early and i went to visit him sunday in la where he is now living with the family and we just had a good time. they played practice rounds at torrey on tuesday and wednesday and had dinner plans thursday night. francesco said they stay in touch constantly mostly through text and calls. buut obviously it s not the same especially after such a long time francesco said. it s definitely the first time that we ve been apart for so long so nice to see him. their golf was fairly similar. francesco opened with a 68 matching his best start to a open. edoardo a former amateur champion shot 70. xander schauffele does n t think the arm lock putting should be allowed but as long as it is he figured he would give it a try. that s not the only addition to his routine. he went horizontal on the greens to get a better read on how the putt might break. it s similar to what patrick reed s brother does not quite to the level of camilo villegas back in the day that earned him the nickname spiderman. i think i m a good green reader and sometimes when i get even lower i may pick up something that i missed just kind of hunched over or crouched over he said. just like the arm lock i m trying to find any way to get myself an advantage. plus look at the bright side. schauffele figures he s getting additional exercise. i think i just started doing it on a few putts and then i kind of liked it and now i m stuck doing 50 push ups every day he said. so it s great. odds are the three olympic medalists from rio de janeiro wo n t be part of the tokyo games next month. this is the final week before the official world golf ranking is used to determine the 60 man field. henrik stenson the silver medalist is at no. 149 in the world and needed a good week to move past henrik norlander no. 134 for the second spot for sweden. stenson opened with a 76 and will be hard pressed to make the cut at the open. justin rose the gold medalist likely needs to win this week to play for britain. bronze medalist matt kuchar could not get in even if he were to win the open this week. the american team is still up in the air. justin thomas is a lock at no. the americans can have a maximum of four players if they are within the top 15 in the world ranking. that wo n t be a problem. the final three spots are up for grabs among collin morikawa bryson dechambeau xander schauffele patrick cantlay and patrick reed all ranked in order between no. matthew wolff stepped away from the pga tour for two months when the frustrations were seeping too much into his well being off the course. he started playing about a month ago mostly to restore the joy of golf. he didn t watch much golf if any. wolff isn t the only pga tour player who doesn t bother watching if they re not playing. but if he does it wouldn t be surprising to see him tune into the lpga tour courtesy of advice from bubba watson. he told me he stopped watching golf he only watches lpga because they re so positive wolff said. the commentators like everyone is just so positive like every shot they hit is the best shot ever. i think it s awesome because these shots are hard out here.

sport,"coach drew thomas placed it around her neck. of course the only reason jones got the medal in the first place was that her spirit never broke during the game. nor did that of her cambria heights softball teammates. jones doubled and scored the go ahead run on ari westrick s line single to center with one out in the top of the seventh. then she closed it out after allowing a one out single in the bottom of the frame by striking out the last two eagle hitters. it was cambria heights 18th win in a row and pushed its record to 21 1. the highlanders will play the loser of thursday s district 3 championship game between bermudian springs and pequea valley in the first round of the piaa tournament on monday either back at st. francis or at mount aloysius college. this is why i m

holding a bald eagle area team that had scored 10 or more runs nine times this season to five hits and no walks. jones westrick and karli storm collected two hits apiece to lead cambria heights at the plate. it was appropriate that westrick had the game winning hit. the highlanders didn t have a baserunner against bald eagle area pitcher maddie peters until westrick and storm laced back to back one out singles to left in the fourth igniting a rally that tied the game at two and warming up the cambria heights bats the rest of the way. westrick could have put her team ahead with two on in the fifth but she lined out to shortstop to end the inning. heights left the bases loaded in the sixth and jones seventh inning double provided westrick a chance at redemption. i was up two innings earlier and didn t get to come through westrick said. i had to do it this time for my team. nothing compares to this. we d been to the playoffs twice before in my four years and didn t make it past the first round. it feels amazing to get here and win it. heights lack of playoff seasoning wasn t going to hold the highlanders back nor was the fact that they were guaranteed a spot in the piaa

sport,"hfx wanderers 2 0 to win the canadian premier league s island games championship in charlottetown on sept. photo by canadian premier league chant photography . the canadian premier league was hoping to be back in its eight respective markets to kick off their third season of professional soccer but unfortunately the covid 19 pandemic is lingering longer than anticipated. so the cpl has gone back to the well with a strategy which was incredibly successful a year ago. this year the league will start in a central location scheduling the first 32 games of the 2021 campaign in winnipeg before returning to its markets to complete the season. on saturday cpl commissioner david clanachan announced the season will commence at ig field in winnipeg on june 26 with a double header featuring fc edmonton against atletico ottawa and pacific fc against hfx wanderers fc. the following day forge fc will face valour fc and cavalry fc will play york united fc. in total each team will play eight matches in winnipeg over a 29 day period to begin the season before returning home to conclude their 28 game schedules. i m pretty pleased to be honest clanachan said saturday. we ve done what we said we were going to do we re going to start our season. everybody is focused on doing our full season that s our pinnacle that s the top of the mountain but someone said to me a long time ago if you wait until all the lights in front of you are all green you ll never get started on your journey. so you have to move and this is our first step in our move and it s great. the way things are changing so rapidly now and there s around 60 per cent of the population in the country with at least one vaccination dose so things are turning the right direction. we have a good plan because we have to get started. a year ago the cpl was forced to alter plans for its second season due to the pandemic and set up an island games tournament in charlottetown which turned out to be a resounding success. a total of 35 matches were played from aug. 19 where forge fc went on to win the title with a 2 0 victory over the hfx wanderers fc in the final. this time the title will not be decided at the tournament but after the teams return home and conclude their final 20 games of the season. we are leaving ourselves flexible so we can adapt and can be nimble and turn on a dime when we get the ok to do such a thing clanachan said. we do not have control of when we can play in each of our markets because that s going to be controlled by governments and by health authorities. what we do have control over however is our readiness to be able to pivot when the moment happens. so you have to remain flexible in order to be able to do that and not get frustrated because there is a lot of frustration to go around on this stuff. i think we ve positioned ourselves really well. we re starting the season in a format we understand and did very well last season so we know we can do it and do it well and people have confidence in us. games in winnipeg will be played in an empty stadium to start but that could change depending on infection rates in manitoba and government approval. the goal is to have fans in the respective stadiums once teams return home in late july and early august. cooperation from the government of manitoba and city of winnipeg has been instrumental in getting the season off the ground to this point. with the entire league descending on the city there will be covid protocols in place for all the teams and their employees. the health and safety of all manitobans is our first priority and public health has been working alongside the canadian premier league and the valour football club to bring this event to winnipeg in a safe manner and within the current public health orders said manitoba chief provincial public health officer dr. brent roussin in a statement. guidelines are in place for team testing before travel during the first seven days and weekly thereafter and players will cohort with their teams and only interact with other teams during matches. additionally essential personnel will be limited and proactive screening monitoring and tracking of participants will be documented to ensure the event is successful and safe. the tournament is being supported by the manitoba chamber of commerce and economic development winnipeg which received 50 million in funding to support projects to kick start the provincial economy. we had 11 different places that wanted to host us for this clanachan said. if you include the united states five of them were international that expressed interest and five of them were from different provinces and we had multiple applications from one province. we had lots of support but winnipeg works well for us. the provincial government has been very supportive winnipeg has been supportive along with the chamber of commerce. there is a number of reasons why we went to winnipeg. ig field is an unbelievable facility and we have a home team market so we you start to layer things in winnipeg made a lot of sense.'

unrest,"ilhan omar has angered her colleagues over remarks about israel before. ilhan omar d. minn. moved to quell an intraparty fight by softening comments she had made earlier in the week that appeared to equate actions by the and israel with those of terrorist organizations. the controversy over the tweet and democratic colleagues reactions highlighted the divisions in the party over middle east policy which deepened during the recent fighting between israel and hamas. during the conflict progressive democrats in both the house and senate briefly attempted to stop a 735 million weapons sale to israel. the new dispute started when ms. omar an outspoken critic of israel tweeted monday we have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the hamas israel afghanistan and the taliban. the tweet was posted along with a video exchange in which she asked secretary of state antony blinken about how victims could find justice for alleged war crimes by the and the taliban in afghanistan and israel and hamas. in response to the tweet some democrats accused her of giving cover to terrorists. ignoring the differences between democracies governed by the rule of law and contemptible organizations that engage in terrorism at best discredits one s intended argument and at worst reflects deep seated prejudice the group of a dozen jewish democrats led by rep. brad schneider d. ill. said in a statement late wednesday night. they asked that she clarify her comment. ms. omar the first black muslim woman to serve in congress initially responded on twitter by saying her colleagues should have reached out to her personally rather than issue a statement and accused them of using anti muslim tropes. the constant harassment silencing from the signers of this letter is unbearable she tweeted. however thursday afternoon she offered a different take on her initial comments pointing to the video exchange that accompanied the tweet. the conversation was about accountability for specific incidents regarding those international criminal court cases not a moral comparison between hamas and the taliban and the and israel. i was in no way equating terrorist organizations with democratic countries with well established judicial systems. shortly after she released that statement house democratic leaders including house speaker nancy pelosi responded that they welcomed the clarification. they said while criticism of the and israel is healthy drawing false equivalencies between democracies like the and israel and groups that engage in terrorism like hamas and the taliban foments prejudice and undermines progress toward peace and security. ms. omar has angered her colleagues over remarks about israel before. in 2019 she apologized for using language that was criticized as anti semitic after both democratic and republican leaders condemned her suggestion that lawmakers support for israel was driven by money from a pro israel group. while ms. omar has been vocal in her frustrations she isn t alone. the party s left flank has become increasingly public in their opposition to policy with israel and the liberal wing came to her defense. members of the democratic caucus owe it to each other to pause reflect and engage directly with each other when misunderstandings arise and stand together against cynical attempts to divide our caucus said rep. pramila jayapal d. wash. chairwoman of the roughly 100 person congressional progressive caucus in a statement issued in support of ms. omar thursday evening. enough with the anti blackness and islamophobia tweeted rep. minority leader kevin mccarthy r. calif. called ms. omar s comments anti semitic and anti american. he said mrs. pelosi s continued failure to address the issues in her caucus sends a message to the world that democrats are tolerant of anti semitism and sympathizing with terrorists. a spokesman for mrs. pelosi pointed the wall street journal to the democratic leadership s broader comment. republicans have struggled with internal division over one of their members as well and mr. mccarthy also has been criticized for his failure to act. eleven republicans joined with democrats to strip rep. marjorie taylor greene r. ga. of her committee assignments earlier this year over her past embrace of conspiracy theories after mr. mccarthy had opted not to remove her from the panels. last month mr. mccarthy and other top republicans condemned comments she made comparing proof of covid 19 vaccinations with actions taken against jewish people by nazi germany leading up to the holocaust.

unrest,"singapore authorities view far right extremism as an emerging major threat in its fight against terrorism alongside groups such as the islamic state according to the city state s latest terrorism threat assessment report. the report noted that radical acts based on racial supremacy as well as anti muslim and anti immigration sentiments had emerged as a major concern in the west. while islamist terrorism remains the primary concern we are also mindful of emergent threats such as far right extremism the internal security department isd said in releasing the third edition of its biannual report. this comes months after authorities nabbed a teenager planning a lone wolf attack against muslim worshippers at mosques in the republic reportedly after he was inspired by the christchurch mosque shootings of 2019. the domestic terrorism threat to singapore stems primarily from self radicalised individuals influenced by extremist materials online. like other countries singapore is vulnerable to attacks against soft targets by lone actors using easily available objects. it said while far right extremism did not have traction in southeast asia some hardline groups had embraced its messages of ethno religious chauvinism and anti immigration nativism . such narratives could deepen societal fault lines and even inspire individuals to mount acts of violence against members of other communities. the report said lone wolf attacks by radicalised individuals could only be uncovered with cooperation from family and friends and listed several signs that someone around us may have become radicalised . they include frequently surfing radical websites posting or sharing extremist views on social media as well as expressing such views with friends and relatives making remarks that promote hatred towards people of other races or religions and expressing intent to join acts of violence overseas. in december last year authorities arrested a 16 year old singaporean under the internal security act for plotting to attack muslims with a machete at two mosques in singapore. the boy a protestant christian of indian ethnicity planned to launch the attacks on the second anniversary of the christchurch mosque attacks in new zealand which killed over 50 worshippers. in february this year authorities detained a 20 year old singaporean muslim man who was planning to carry out a knife attack against jews at a synagogue. amirull ali a national serviceman in the singapore armed forces had planned to target three jewish men at the maghain aboth synagogue in waterloo street.

unrest,"the strategy focuses on providing a national framework for the us government and partners to share information related to domestic terrorism  preventing domestic terrorism recruitment and violent mobilization  disrupting and deterring domestic terrorism activity and confronting long term contributors to domestic terrorism. the new strategy marks a major break from former president donald trump s administration and addresses more directly the threats posed by white supremacists and right wing militia groups. senior administration officials told reporters that though the approach is ideologically neutral  the administration will build on its previous assessment that white supremacists and anti government militias pose the most lethal threat. president joe biden said earlier this month that white supremacy was the most lethal threat to the homeland today  in a speech commemorating the 100th anniversary of the tulsa race massacre. biden has discussed the issue with attorney general merrick garland  homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas  secretary of defense lloyd austin  secretary of state antony blinken and others  emphasizing the need to conduct this work in a way that never undermines those freedoms  those values and those legal guardrails in order to get an objective and fact based review of the threats that we face  the official said. biden ordered a 100 day comprehensive review of us government efforts to address domestic terrorism on his first full day in office. the first pillar of the new strategy is to understand  analyze and share domestic terrorism related information with federal  state  local  tribal and territorial levels as the department of justice and fbi has implemented a new system to track domestic terrorism cases nationwide. the second pillar involves a 77 million proposed budget within the department of homeland security to prevent domestic terrorism  recruitment and mobilization to violence by working with communities to help them become more resilient to prevent individuals from ever reaching the point of committing terrorist violence. the federal government will also enhance its efforts to address online domestic terrorist recruitment and mobilization to violence through increased information sharing with the technology sector. the third pillar involves a disruption and deterrence of domestic terrorist activity which includes more than 100 million in additional resources for the doj  fbi and dhs  which is included in biden s fiscal year 2022 budget  to ensure that the federal government has the necessary resources to thwart domestic terrorism. the justice department is looking at whether new legislative authorities are appropriate to balance safety and the protection of civil liberties. during the ongoing investigation into the january 6 insurrection  prosecutors have revealed that some of those charged in connection to storming the us capitol were former military and current police officers from across the country. the investigation also found that many of those charged belong to white supremacy groups that include the proud boys  oath keepers and three percenters. we will work to ensure that law enforcement operates without bias in countering domestic terrorism and provides for the public safety of all americans. in a true democracy  violence cannot be an acceptable mode of seeking political or social change  a fact sheet from the white house "" "

weather,"the good news about kubernetes and microservices is that they allow enterprises to deploy updates and new features faster and at higher volumes. unfortunately that s also the bad news because if something goes wrong it can be tremendously complex for the devops team to go back and figure out what caused the problem. tel aviv based komodor launched 18 months ago to streamline and automate that troubleshooting process. by centralizing data about all updates and changes the platform allows devops to pinpoint and repair an issue in a fraction of the time. there are two things that we realized that are happening at once said ben ofiri ceo and cofounder of komodor. with the migration to the cloud everything is code today. and the second thing that happened is the adoption of microservices and specifically kubernetes. both of those things combined led to the fact that companies today can move much faster. today the company got a big boost when it officially came out of stealth mode and announced that it had raised 21 million. accel led the round which also included funding from previous angel investors such as jason warner cto of github sri viswanath cto of atlassian danny grander cofounder of snyk tomer levy ceo of amir jerbi co founder of aqua security. the company has now raised a total of 25 million. ofiri experienced the growing challenging facing devops while working at google on its duplex conversational ai project. he cofounded komodor with itiel shwartz now cto who previously worked as an engineer at ebay. above komodor cofounders cto itiel shwartz left and ceo ben ofiri. as the adoption of kubernetes and microservices began to surge a couple of years ago the pair saw how devops were struggling to keep pace with troubleshooting demands. alerts would go off and teams would be scrambling to decrypt the issues and work through the growing complexity often spending hours trying to reconstruct what updates had been pushed out across various parts of the network and infrastructure. companies are making thousands of changes every day ofiri said. so on one side it s great right the ceo today likes to see that we made tons of changes. it probably means that we pushed out new features and fixed all the bugs. but the downside whenever something is off the first question you ask yourself is what the heck changed in the system . to address this issue and simplify the task the komodor platform connects to an enterprise s it infrastructure and immediately begins scanning all of it to create a single unified view of all changes. that includes data from all deploys configuration changes past incidents and data from any third party services integrated into the enterprise. now when there s an alert rather than going over scattered logs for different aspects of the system the devops team can just look at the komodor dashboard. that dynamic is what attracted accel to komodor according to partner seth pierrepont. he said the firm had been tracking a paradigm shift happening within the enterprise around developers taking responsibility for incident response. many of them don t have all the skillsets to navigate all the parts of the it system. the problem and this is particularly an issue with microservice infrastructure because of its inherent complexity is that the developers just aren t equipped with either the tools or the experience to deal with these issues pierrepont said. and so when you have an incident with your infrastructure they end up on this kind of treasure hunt trying to figure out what changed what happened what went wrong. komodor says let me actually abstract away a lot of this complexity and serve up the answer about what changed in a single pane of glass and help you troubleshoot just far more efficiently than you were able to do so in the past. komodor is already live with customers which is helping the company to continue the development of the product. over time ofiri said the company wants to expand from a diagnostic posture to help prevent issues and eventually automatically repairing problems. i want to be the platform that helps people to understand what happened to manage the issue and to prevent it from happening again in your system he said.

weather,"ap search and rescue teams worked through the night encountering rainstorms and small fires in the rubble hoping to detect any sounds coming from survivors following the collapse of a beachside condominium complex near miami. the crews which include some 130 firefighters working in teams are approaching the pile from above and below as they search for any signs of life in what had been a wing of the champlain towers south in surfside florida. the tower collapsed early thursday leaving 159 people unaccounted for she said. but friday s focus remained on finding survivors among the rubble which is more than 30 feet 9 meters high. crews have heard some tapping and other noises but assistant miami dade fire chief raide jadallah emphasized that the rescuers don t know whether the sounds are human made or just caused by the settling of the huge mass of concrete metal and other belongings lost in the collapse. any time that we hear a sound we concentrate in that area jadallah said during a news conference friday morning. it could be just steel twisting it could be debris raining down but not specifically sounds of tapping or sounds of a human voice. heavy cranes are removing debris from the pile using large claws creating a sound of crashing glass and metal as they pick up a haul and dump it to the side. at the same time firefighters are tunneling from below using saws and jackhammers to search for pockets in the rubble jadallah said. levine cava said it is incredibly motivating to watch the search and rescue teams. this work is being done at extreme risk to these individuals. debris is falling on them as they do their work she said. we have structural engineers on site to ensure that they will not be injured but they are proceeding because they are so motivated and they are taking extraordinary risk on the site every day. jadallah said firefighters know the risk but are driven by the hope of finding survivors. this is the risk that we take it s the risk vs. benefit he said. every time that we have that belief that there s hope with personnel that are trapped we do risk our lives.""
